            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NOtwithſtanding the great and unvaluable good that hath in all
ages of the World accrued to Mankind by Order and Goverment, yet ſuch is the
depravedneſs of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and imperfection of his knowledge, that it is
as well hard to find out, as difficult to maintain, ſuch a Form and Order of
Goverment as will prove a ſufficient Fence and ſecurity for ſo great a
treaſure as is the common good, and publick ſafety. After the ſad and
long experience of former times, ſome have thought no means can be found out
ſo effectual for the upholding and and preſerving the ſame, with all the
ſacred and civill rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges therunto belonging, as a liberty
for people to deſigne and chooſe out from among themſelves, the perſons
that are to be intruſted with thoſe great concerns. Whatever may be ſaid
for the extolling the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of them that have ſuch an advantage in
their hands, all that may be comprehended within the compaſs of ſuch a
power, it is for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the principal and leading part thereof
devolved upon your ſelves in all the three Colonies of <hi>New-England;</hi>
who by the choyce of the free people in thoſe your ſeveral Juriſdictions,
are now called to act your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts as chief on the publick ſtage of
Goverment. Ever ſince you have taken your turns at the helm, there have been
very boiſterous winds and rough Seas, threatning the ſhipwrack of all;
which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, you need not be diſcouraged, while due
conſideration is had, to whom, and what you have embarqued with you. When
once the great <hi>Roman Conquerer,</hi> and chief founder of their Monarchy,
was paſſing the <hi>Adriatick Sea</hi> in a diſguize, the Pilot being
diſmayed with the fierceneſs of the wind, the raging of the waves, his
Paſſenger pulled off his diſguize, and <pb facs="tcp:171788:4"/> bid him be of good
courage and not fear, for he carried <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and all his Fortunes:
Surely Jeſus Chriſt and all his promiſes, in which you are not a little

ſhall be a cleer breaking forth of the ſun, after the tempeſt is over;

plucked up. It is with young Colonies, as it is with trees newly planted, which

            </head>
            <p>THe following hiſtorical Eſſay, was when firſt drawn up,
intended only for the ſatiſfaction of a private Friend, &amp; not for the
uſe of the publick, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hope I may be excuſed, if I fall ſhort
therein of that exactneſs, which might be expected from one that deſignedly
undertook a Work of this nature: however truſting more to the judgment of
ſome who have accidentally had the peruſal thereof, then mine own, I am not
unwilling that others ſhould receive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit thereby. The Compiler of an
Hiſtory can challenge little to himſelf but methodizing the work, the
materials being found to his hand: diligence in gathering them together, and
faithfulneſs in improving them, is all that is upon point required of him, in
both which I have endeavoured to make good, what the profeſſion I have now
taken up obliges me unto. The matters of fact therein related (being rather
Maſſacres, barbarous inhumane outrages, then acts of Hoſtility, or
valiant atchievements) no more deſerve the name of a VVarre, then the report
of them the title of an Hiſtory, therefore I contented my ſelf with a
Narrative. Much of what is therein mentioned, depending on the ſingle
authority of particular perſons, an exact deſcription of every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current
was hardly to be obtained: All Souldiers are not like <hi>Caeſar,</hi> able
to deſcribe with their pens, what they have done with their Swords: But the
moſt material paſſages inſerted, were either gathered out of the
Letters, or taken from the mouthes of ſuch as were eye or ear-witneſſes
of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and thoſe alſo perſons worthy of credit. In
ſuch paſſages as were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly reported by the Actors, or Spectators,
that which ſeemed moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is only inſerted. If any error be
committed about the Scituation or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of places, it may deſerve an
excuſe rather then a cenſure: For our Souldiers in the purſuit of their
enemies being drawn into many deſert places, inacceſſible Woods, and
unknown Paths, which no Geographers hand ever meaſured, ſcarce any vultures
eye had ever ſeen, there was a neceſſity to take up many things in
reference thereunto upon no better credit ſometimes then common Report. One
or two paſſages need a more particular excuſe, or at leaſt explication:
As where it is ſaid, <hi>p.</hi> 2. <hi>that the firſt Colony was ſent
hither</hi> Anno, 1606, The miſtake is eaſily helped, by minding the Reader
that the Patent or Commiſſion was that year granted, when alſo Capt.
<hi>Henery Challons</hi> was ſent over upon ſome further diſcovery of the
Country, before the Adventurers would hazard a greater charge: ſoon after the
departure of the ſaid <hi>Challons,</hi> the ſame year Sr. <hi>John
Popham,</hi> one of the principal under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers, ſent out another ſhip to
ſecond him under the Command of Capt. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Martin P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in of Briſtow</hi> being Maſter,
who not finding <hi>Challons</hi> (for he miſcaried in his deſign being
ſeized by ſome Strangers in the way) yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning <pb facs="tcp:171788:6"/> with good
news the next year they ſent out two ſhips with an hundred men, with
Ordnance and other Proviſion, under the conduct of Capt. <hi>George
Popham</hi> &amp; Capt. <hi>Rawley Gilbert,</hi> who built a Fort in ſome
place about <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga de hoch,</hi> called S. <hi>Georges Fort,</hi> the ruines
of which are remaining to this day, as ſome ſay. Probably other like
miſtakes may be obſerved, in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing the bounds and dimenſions of
ſome of the Patents, &amp; grants of land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the other Colonies;
but an Hiſtorian being no Pretorian Judge, his report cannot prejudice any
peoples Juriſdiction, or perſons propriety.</p>
            <p>Further alſo where it is ſaid, <hi>p.</hi> 7. <hi>That the
Indians had lived peaceably with the Engliſh here near forty years, ever
ſince the</hi> Pequod <hi>Warr;</hi> it is to be underſtood with reference
to publick acts of Hoſtility; for particular miſchiefs have been committed
by ſeveral Indians in ſome parts of the Country but the actors were not
abetted therein by any of their Country-men: As at <hi>Nantucket,</hi> an
Iſland to the eaſtward of <hi>Cape Cod,</hi> where in the end of the year
1664. ſome villanous Indians murthered ſome that ſuffered ſhipwrack
upon that I ſtand, yet juſtice was done upon two or three of the chief
actors. In like manner within a few years after the <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>quod Warrs,</hi> Mris. <hi>Hutchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> was killed
by the Indians near a Dutch Plantation; about which time ſome other
inſolencies of like nature were acted by the Indians ſouthward, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon long Iſland, or in ſome place within <hi>New-haven</hi> Colony. Alſo
a murther was committed at <hi>Farmington,</hi> another at <hi>Woburn,</hi> by
ſome Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in their drunken humors, upon a maid-ſervant or two, who
denied them drink. All which hinder not the truth of what is affirmed in the
Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, ſuch murthers being too frequently committed in the moſt
peaceable pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the world. Such errors as are the forementioned, being
overlooked by the Candid Reader, it is preſumed, there will not be many other
faults to be complained of, unleſs ſuch as are meerly Typographical, or
elſe were ocaſioned by the dropping in of particular paſſages, after
the whole was drawn up, which I was willing to inſert, although it
occaſioned the diſcourſe in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to be a little more
confuſed then elſe would have been. If ever the matter require another
edition, more acurateneſs may be obſerved. If thoſe into whoſe hand
theſe ſhall happen to come, find any ſatiſfaction about the
occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents, that have here fallen out, the Publiſher ſhall account his
pains well beſtowed.</p>

            <head>A NARRATIVE OF THE TROUBLES VVith the <hi>Indians</hi> in
<hi>NEVV-ENGLAND,</hi> From the firſt Planting thereof to the preſent
time.</head>
            <p>KNown unto God are all his works from the foundation of the world,
though manifeſt to us, only by the events of time, that fruitful mother of
all things, which in the former age did bring forth, at leaſt did bring to
light the knowledge of this weſtern World, called <hi>America,</hi> that in
all foregoing times and ages, lay hid in this obſcure and remote Region,
covered with a veyle of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and locked up from the knowledge of all the
reſt of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Earth. To whom the honour of its
inveſtigation doth of eight more properly belong, is ſufficiently declared
by the Hyſtory and Reports of ſuch as were ey witneſſes thereof, and
not intended to be any part of the preſent diſquiſition. The moſt
conſiderable part of all the North ſide of <hi>America,</hi> is called
<hi>New-England.</hi> In the fertility of the Soyle, ſalubriouſneſs of
the Air, and many other commodious advantages, moſt reſembling the Country
from whence it borrowed its appellation. For the knowledge thereof the World is
moſt behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the diſcoveries of the Engliſh, under the conduct of
<hi>Sebaſtian Cabbot</hi> a famous Porteguez about the year 1497. though
ſince much <pb n="2" facs="tcp:171788:11"/> perfected by the induſtry and travels of
Captain <hi>Goſnold,</hi> Captain <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> Captain <hi>Smith,</hi>
and others of the Engliſh Nation. <hi>North-America</hi> this poſthumous
birth of time, is as to its nativity, of the ſame ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her two
elder Siſters <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Mexico,</hi> yet was ſuffered to ly in
its Swadling-clothes, one whole Century of years, nature having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed no
ſuch Dowry of rich Mines of Silver and Gold to them that would eſpouſe
her for their own, as ſhe did unto the other two, which poſſibly was the
reaſon why ſhe was not ſo haſtily deflowred by her firſt
diſcoverers, nor yet ſo early courted by any of the Princes of
<hi>Europe,</hi> lying wholly neglected as it were, until a ſmall company of
Planters, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of Captain <hi>George Popham,</hi> and Captain
<hi>Gilbert</hi> were ſent over at the charge of Sir <hi>John Popham</hi> in
the year 1606. to begin a Colony upon a Tract of Land about <hi>Saga de
hoch,</hi> ſcituate on the ſouth ſide of the River of <hi>Kennibeck</hi>
and about that called <hi>Shipſcot River,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twenty miles
ſouth-Weſt from <hi>Pemmaquid,</hi> the moſt Northerly bound of all
<hi>New-England.</hi> But that deſign within two years expiring with its
firſt Founder, ſoon after ſome honourable perſons of the Weſt of
<hi>England,</hi> commonly called the Counſel of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> being
more certainly informed of ſeveral Navigable Rivers and commodious Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
with other places fit either for Traffick or Planting, newly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by
many skilful Navigators, obtained a Grant by Patent, under the great Seal from
King <hi>James</hi> of bleſſed memory, of all that part of
<hi>North-America,</hi> called <hi>New-England.</hi> From the 40 to the 48
<hi>gr.</hi> of North Latitude. From which Grand and Original Patent, all other
Charters and Graunts of Land from <hi>Pemmaquid</hi> to <hi>Delaware Bay,</hi>
along the Sea-coaſt, derive their Linage and Pedigree; thus was that vaſt
tract of Land, after the year 1612. cantoned and parcelled out into many
leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Diviſions and parcels, according as Adventurers preſented,
which ſaid Graunts being founded upon uncertain, or falſe Deſcriptions,
and Reports of ſome that Travelled thither, did many of them interfere one
upon another, to the great diſturbance of the firſt Planters, and
preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the Proprietors themſelves, as is too well known by any that
have had occaſion to ſtay never ſo little amongſt them, many of whom
are yet ſurviving. For notwithſtanding the great charge and vaſt expences
the firſt Adventurers were at, the firſt Proprietors of the whole
<hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Mayne</hi> and others (reaching from the head of
<hi>Caſco Bay</hi> North-eaſt to the mouth of <hi>Paſcat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>qua River</hi> about ſixty miles
Weſtward) and the hopes they might have conceived of being the firſt
Founders of <hi>New-Colonies,</hi> and of enlarging their Eſtates and
Inheritances by thoſe new acquired poſſeſſions and Lordſhips, there
was little profit reaped from <pb n="3" facs="tcp:171788:11"/> thence after the rich fleeces
of Beaver were gleaned away, nor any great improvement made of thoſe large
portions of Lands, ſave the erecting of ſome few Cottages for Fiſhermen,
and a few inconſiderable Buildings for the Planters, which were on thoſe
occaſions drawn over the Sea, to ſettle upon the moſt northerly parts of
<hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whither it were by the imprudence of the firſt Adventurers,
or the diſſoluteneſs of the perſons they ſent over to manage their
Affairs, or whither want of faithfulneſs or skill to manage their truſt,
they were by degrees in a manner quite deſerted almoſt of Laws and
Government, and left to ſhift for themſelves, by which means at laſt they
fell under the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Maſſachuſets Colony,</hi> not by
Uſurpation, as is by great miſtake ſuggeſted to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi>
but by neceſſity, and the earneſt deſire of the Planters themſelves;
to accept of whom, thoſe of the <hi>Maſſachuſets Colony</hi> were the
more eaſily induced; in that they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the bounds of their own
Patent, by a favourable Interpretation of the words deſcribing the Northern
Line [Three miles beyond the moſt Northerly branch of Merimack River] do
reach ſomewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Pemmaquid,</hi> the North-weſt limits of all
<hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the firſt beginning of things in <hi>New-England,</hi>
at which time they were not unlike the times of old, when the people of
<hi>Judah</hi> were ſaid to be without a Teaching Prieſt, and without Law;
and no wonder things were no more ſucceſsfully carried on.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1620. a Company belonging to Mr. <hi>Robinſons</hi>
Church at <hi>Leyden</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> although they had been
courteouſly entertained by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as Strangers ſojourning
amongſt them, yet foreſeeing many inconveniencies like to increaſe, and
that they could not ſo well provide for the good of their Poſterity, under
the Government of a forreign Nation; they reſolved to intreat ſo much
favour from their own Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Prince King <hi>James,</hi> as to grant them
liberty under the ſhelter of his Royal Authority, to place themſelves in
ſome part of <hi>New-England,</hi> then newly diſcovered; wherefore having
obtained ſome kind of Patent or Graunt, for ſome place about <hi>Hudſons
River,</hi> they ſet ſayle from <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> in <hi>September</hi>
for the Southern parts of <hi>New-England,</hi> but as they intended to bend
their courſe thitherward, <hi>per varios caſus, per tot dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimina
rerum;</hi> they were at laſt caſt upon a boſome of the South Cape of the
<hi>Maſſachuſets Bay,</hi> called <hi>Cape Cod,</hi> about the
11<hi>th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> from whence the Winter ſo faſt
approaching, they had no opportunity to remove; and finding ſome
incouragement from the hopefulneſs of the Soyle, and courteſie of the
Heathen, they reſolved there to make their abode for the future, which they
did, laying the foundation of a new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, <pb n="4" facs="tcp:171788:12"/> which from the
remembrance of the laſt Town in <hi>England</hi> they ſailed from, they
called <hi>New-Plimouth;</hi> containing no very conſiderable Tract of Land,
ſcarce extending an hundred miles in length through the whole Cape, and
ſcarce half ſo much in breadth where it is broadeſt. The firſt Founders
of that Colony aiming more at Religion then Earthly Poſſeſſions,
aſpiring not to any large dimenſion of Land, in their ſetling upon
thoſe Coaſts.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Weymouth</hi> alſo was a Plantation begun by Mr.
<hi>Weſton</hi> in the year 1622. but it came to little.</p>
            <p>The North and South Border of the <hi>Maſſachuſets Bay</hi>
being thus planted, the middle part was the more eaſie to be filled up, which
thus was brought about. Some Gentlemen and others, obſerving how it fared
with thoſe of <hi>New-Plimouth,</hi> were deſiring upon the like ground to
make the ſame attempt for themſelves, wherefore having by a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
ſum of money purchaſed of the Councell of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> all their
right and intereſt in a Plantation there begun in the <hi>Maſſachuſets
Bay,</hi> and having attained a confirmation thereof by Patent from King
<hi>Charls</hi> of famous memory, in the year 1628, they ſent over a
Governour with ſeveral perſons to lay ſome foundation of an other Colony
in the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſets Bay:</hi> and in the year 1630, more of the
perſons intereſted in the ſaid <hi>Patent</hi> (thence commonly called
<hi>Patentees</hi>) with ſeveral other perſons, intending to venture their
lives and all with them, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported themſelves and their Families into
the ſaid <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> who did in a ſhort ſpace of time by
the acceſſion of many hundreds, who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very year flocked after them, make
ſuch increaſe, that in the ſpace of five or ſix years, there were
twenty conſiderable Towns built and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, and many of the Towns firſt
planted, became ſo filled with Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, that like Swarms of Bees they
were ready to ſwarm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, not only
into new Plantations, but into new Colonies, inſomuch that in the year 1635 a
new Colony began to be planted upon <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, partly by
combination amongſt themſelves, removing from ſome Towns about the
<hi>Maſſachuſets Bay,</hi> and partly by the intereſt of a Patent
purchaſed of that honourable Gentle man Mr. <hi>Fennick,</hi> Agent for the
Lord <hi>Sey,</hi> and Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> the Lords Proprietors of the ſaid
River <hi>Connecticut,</hi> at the mouth of which River they had built a Fort,
(called after their own titles <hi>Sey-Brook Fort</hi>) commanding the
paſſage of the ſaid River. Yea ſuch was the Confluence of people making
over into thoſe parts, that in the year 1637 a fourth Colony began to be
planted, bearing the name of <hi>Newhaven</hi> from the firſt Town erected
therein, ſeated near the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way betwixt <hi>Hudſons River</hi> and that of
<hi>Connecticot.</hi> The Sea coaſt from <pb n="5" facs="tcp:171788:12"/> the pitch of

ſeveral nations of Indians, <hi>Wompanoogs</hi> (the firſt Authors of the
preſent Rebellion) <hi>Narhaganſits, Pequods, Mohegins,</hi> as the more
inland part of the Country by the <hi>Nipnets</hi> (a general name for all
inland Indians betwixt the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> and <hi>Connecticut
River</hi>) The Sea-coaſt South-weſt from <hi>Plimouth</hi> was firſt
poſſeſſed by ſome diſcontented with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment of the
<hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> Colony, from which ſome being exiled, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of
their friends accompanying of them, ſetled themſelves upon a fair Iſland
to the South-weſt of <hi>Cape Cod,</hi> now called <hi>Road-Iſland,</hi>
others ſetled upon the Mayn, at a place called <hi>Providence,</hi> and ſo
by degrees planting toward <hi>Narrhaganſet Bay,</hi> made another Plantation
called <hi>Warwick,</hi> which places are ſince by Patent conferred upon the
Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Road-Iſland;</hi> the reſt of the Country from
<hi>Pequod River</hi> to the River of <hi>Connecticot,</hi> falling within the
bounds of <hi>Connecticot Colony</hi> by Patent alſo, ſince confirmed to
the ſaid Colony. Things had been very proſperouſly and ſucceſfully
carried on in all the foreſaid Colonyes and Juriſdictions, from the year
1620, to the year 1636, at which time the <hi>Pequod</hi> Indians, the moſt
warlike and fierce of all the Indians in that part of the Country, who had made
all the reſt of the Indians to ſtand in awe, having committed many
barbarous outrages upon their neighbour Indians, both <hi>Narhaganſets</hi>
on the eaſt ſide, and <hi>Mohegins</hi> on the weſt ſide of them: and
alſo upon the Engliſh and Dutch, as they came occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally to traffick
with them: and in the year 1634, having barbarou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly murthered Capt. Stone
and Capt. Norton, as they were trading with them. Afterwards one
<hi>Oldham</hi> coming amongſt them upon the like account. In like manner
having committed ſeveral outrages upon the planters about <hi>Connecticut
River,</hi> the Inhabitants of all the Colonyes, unanimouſly ſetting upon
them in the beginning of the year 1637, they were eaſily ſuppreſſed,
about 700 of them deſtroyed, the reſt either fled to the <hi>Mohawkes,</hi>
by whom they were all cut off that eſcaped, or elſe ſheltring
themſelves under the <hi>Narhaganſets</hi> &amp; <hi>Mohegins</hi> their
neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, they were by the power of the Engliſh all ſubjected to one of
thoſe two Nations of the Indians. <hi>Miantonimoh</hi> the chief Sachem or
Lord of the <hi>Narhaganſets,</hi> expecting to be ſole Lord and Ruler over
all the Indians, after the <hi>Pequods</hi> were ſubdued, began to quarrell
with the <hi>Mohegins</hi> upon the account of Soveraignty, notwithſtanding a
firm A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement was made betwixt the Engliſh and the ſaid
<hi>Narhaganſets</hi> in the year 1637, when they had helped to deſtroy the
<hi>Pequods,</hi> and alſo notwithſtanding the tripartite League between
the ſaid <hi>Narhaganſets,</hi> the <hi>Mohegins,</hi> and the Engliſh at
<hi>Hartford</hi> (the chief Town of <hi>Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut</hi> 
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:171788:13"/>
Colony) made in the year 1638, wherein the ſaid Indians were ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
ingaged not to quarrel either with the Mohegins, or any other Indians, untill
they had firſt asked the advice of the Engliſh, to whoſe determination
they had likewiſe obliged themſelves to ſtand, in all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fferences among them. Yet did theſe
ambitious <hi>Narhaganſets</hi> ſpecially their chief Leader
<hi>Miantonimoh;</hi> bare ſuch an inveterate hatred againſt the
<hi>Mohegins,</hi> that they were every year picking quarrels with them. The
<hi>Mohegins</hi> on the other ſide though not ſo numerous, yet a more
warlike people and more politick, alwayes made their recourſe to the
Engliſh, complaining of the inſolencies of the <hi>Narhaganſets,</hi>
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their League, ſo as they would hardly be kept from making open
warre againſt them, when they ſaw all other attempts to kill and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncas</hi> the <hi>Mohegin</hi> Sachem, by Treachery, poyſon, &amp;
Sorcery prove ineffectual. Inſomuch that at laſt the malice of
<hi>Miantonimoh</hi> and his <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> grew to that height, that
they began to plot againſt the Engliſh themſelves, for defending of
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncas.</hi> But it being diſcovered by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncas</hi> and ſome of
his men to the Engliſh; <hi>Miantonimoh</hi> was ſent for by the
<hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> Court to come to <hi>Boſton,</hi> when he came
there, he would have denyed thoſe things laid to his charge, he was convicted
by one of his own fellowers; and inſtead of ſtanding to his promiſe, to
deliver him to the <hi>Mohegin</hi> Sachem whoſe Subject he was, going
home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he cut off his head, to prevent his telling more tales. And with
great diſcontent as he was going home ſaid he would come no more at
<hi>Boſton,</hi> wherein he proved a truer prophet then he himſelf believed
when he uttered the words, for in the end of the ſame year 1643 making war
upon <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncas,</hi> he was taken priſoner by him, and ſoon after by the
advice of the Commiſſioners of the four Colonyes, (at that time united
firmly into a League offenſive and defenſive, on which account they were
after that time called the united Colonyes of <hi>New England:</hi> though
ſince that time they are reduced but to three Colonyes; that of
<hi>New-haven</hi> and <hi>Connecticot</hi> by the laſt Patent being
conjoyned in one) his head was cut off by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncas,</hi> it being juſtly
feared, that there would never be any firm peace, either betwixt the Engliſh
and the <hi>Narhaganſets,</hi> or betwixt the <hi>Narhaganſets</hi> and the
<hi>Mohegins,</hi> while <hi>Miantonimoh</hi> was left alive: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the
<hi>Narhaganſets</hi> have ever ſince that time borne an implacable malice
againſt <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncas,</hi> and all the <hi>Mohegins,</hi> and for their
ſakes ſecretly againſt the Engliſh, ſo far as they durſt diſcover
it.</p>
            <p>In the years 1645, and 1646. they grew ſo inſolent, that the
Commiſſioners of the united Colonyes were compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to raiſe Forces to
go againſt them, but when they perceived that <pb n="7" facs="tcp:171788:13"/> the
Engliſh were in good earneſt, they began to be afraid, and ſued for
peace, and ſubmitted to pay a tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>bute to ſatiſfy for the charge of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the warr,
but were alwayes very backward to make payment untill the Engliſh were forced
to demand it by new Forces, ſo that it appeared they were unwillingly willing
to hold any friendly correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with the Engliſh, yet durſt they
never make any open attempt upon them, untill the preſent Rebellion, where in
that t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ir pretences to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as will appear in the ſequell of
this Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>Thus it is apparent upon what Terms the Engliſh ſtood with the
<hi>Narhaganſets,</hi> ever ſince the cutting off <hi>Miantonimoh,</hi>
their chief Sachems head by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncas,</hi> it being done from the advice and
Counſell of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh <hi>Anno.</hi> 1043. As for the reſt of the
Indians, ever ſince the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the <hi>Pequods</hi> in the
year 1637 untill the year 1675, there was alwayes in appearance amity and good
correſpondence on all ſides, ſcarce an Engliſh man was ever known to be
aſſaulted or hurt by any of them, until after the year 1671, when the ſon
of one <hi>Matoonas,</hi> who as was ſuppoſed, being vexed in his mind that
the deſign againſt the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, intended to begin 1671 did not take
place, out of meer malice and ſpight againſt them, ſlew an Engliſh man
travelling along the Road, the ſaid <hi>Matoonas</hi> being a <hi>Nipnet</hi>
Indian, which <hi>Napnets</hi> were under the command of the Sachem of
<hi>Mount-hope</hi> the Author of all the preſent miſchiefs. Upon a due
enquiry into all preceding tranſactions between the Indians and the
Engliſh, from their firſt ſetling in theſe coaſts, there will appear
no ground of quarrell that any of them had againſt the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, nor any
appearance of provocation upon one account or other; for when <hi>Plimouth</hi>

<hi>Philip</hi> with him, deſiring that there might be Love and Amity after

People from their old Pagan Superſtition, and Deviliſh Idolatry, to the
Chriſtian Religion, and did much inſiſt upon it till he ſaw the
Engliſh were reſolved never to make any Treaty with him more upon that
account, which when he diſcerned, he did not further urge it: but that was a
bad Omen that notwithſtanding what ever his humanity were to the Engliſh,

the reſt of their Neighbours of <hi>Mount Hope,</hi> there being very few of
them now left ſtanding. Nor is it unworthy the Relation, what a perſon of

the Indians about <hi>Merimack River,</hi> being <hi>Anno.</hi> 1660.

(which ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are the times they make uſe of to tell their ſtories,

Poſterity) <hi>Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conaway,</hi> the great Sachim of that part of the

Children and People, that were then all gathered together, to whom he
addreſſed himſelf in this manner:</p>
            <q>I am now going the way of all Fleſh, or ready to dy, and not
likely to ſee you ever met together any more; I will now leave this word of
Counſel with you, that you take heed how you quarrel with the Engliſh, for
though you may do them much miſchief; yet aſſuredly you will all be
deſtroyed, and rooted off the Earth if you do: for, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> I was
as much an Enemy to the Engliſh, at their firſt coming into theſe parts,
as any one whatſoever, and did try all ways and means poſſible to have
deſtroyed them, at leaſt to have prevented them ſitting down here, but I
could no way effect it (it is to be noted that this <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaconaway</hi>
was the moſt noted <hi>Pawaw</hi> and <hi>Sorcerer</hi> of all the Country)
therefore I adviſe you never to contend with the Engliſh, nor make war with
them: And accordingly his eldeſt Son <hi>Wonnalancet</hi> by name, as ſoon
as he perceived that the Indians were up in Arms, he withdrew himſelf into
ſome remote place, that he might not be hurt by the Engliſh, or the
Enemies, or be in danger by them.</q>

thought fit to be inſerted here, it having ſo near an agreement with the
former, intimating ſome ſecret awe of God upon the hearts of ſome of the
principal amongſt them, that they durſt not hurt the Engliſh, although
they bare no good affection to their Religion, wherein they ſeem not a little
to imitate <hi>Balaam,</hi> who whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he uttered, when he was under the
awful power of divine illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet when left to himſelf, was as bad an
Enemy to the Iſrael of God as ever before.</p>
            <p>But to return, whence there hath been this Digreſſion:</p>
            <p>After the death of this <hi>Wooſamequen</hi> or
<hi>Maſſaſoit,</hi> his eldeſt Son ſucceeded him about twenty years
ſince, <hi>Alexander</hi> by name, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the League he had
entred into with the Engliſh, together with his Father, in the year 1639. had
neither affection to the Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens perſons, nor yet to their Religion,
but had been plotting with the <hi>Narhaganſets,</hi> to riſe againſt the
Engliſh, of which the Governour and Council of <hi>Plimouth</hi> being
informed, they preſently ſent for him to bring him to the Court, the
perſon to whom that ſervice was committed, was a prudent and reſolute
Gentleman, the preſent Governour of the ſaid Colony, who was neither afraid
of Danger, nor yet willing to delay in a <pb n="10" facs="tcp:171788:15"/> matter of that
moment, he forthwith taking eight or ten ſtout men with him well armed,
intended to have gone to the ſaid <hi>Alexanders</hi> dwelling, diſtant at
leaſt forty miles from the Governours houſe, but by a good providence, he
found him whom he went to ſeek at an Hunting Houſe, within ſix miles of
the Engliſh Towns, where the ſaid <hi>Alexander</hi> with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eighty men
were newly come in from Hunting, and had left their Guns without doors, which
Major <hi>Winſlow</hi> with his ſmall company wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeized, and
conveyed away, and then went into the Wigwam, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Alexander</hi>
to go along with him before the Governour, at which meſſage he was much
appalld, but being told by the undaunted Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, that if he ſtird or
refuſed to go he was a dead man; he was by one of his chief Counſellors, in
whoſe advice he moſt confided, perſwaded to go along to the Governours
houſe, but ſuch was the pride and height of his Spirit, that the very
ſurprizal of him, raiſed his Choler and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it put him into
a Feaver, which notwithſtanding all poſſible means that could be uſed,
ſeemed Mortal; whereupon intreating thoſe that held him Priſoner, that he
might have liberty to return home, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to return again if he
recovered, and to ſend his Son as Hoſtage till he could ſo do; on that
conſideration he was fairly diſmiſſed, but dyed before he got half way
home: Here let it be obſerved, that although ſome have taken up falſe
Reports, as if the Engliſh had compelled him to go further or faſter then
he was able, and ſo fell into a Feaver, or as if he were not well uſed by
the Phyſitian that looked to him, while he was with the Engliſh, all which
are notoriouſly falſe; nor is it to be imagined that a perſon of ſo
noble a diſpoſition as is that Gentleman (at that time imployed to bring
him) ſhould himſelf, or ſuffer any elſe to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civil to a perſon
allied to them, by his own, as well as his Fathers League as the ſaid
<hi>Philip</hi> alſo was; nor was any thing of that nature ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to
the Engliſh of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> by the ſaid <hi>Alexanders Brother,</hi>
by name <hi>Philip,</hi> commonly for his ambitious and haughty Spirit
nicknamed <hi>King-Philip,</hi> when he came in the year 1662. in his own
perſon with <hi>Sauſaman</hi> his Secretary and chief Counſellor to renew
the former league that had been between his Predeceſſors and the Engliſh
of <hi>Plimouth:</hi> but there was as much correſpondence betwixt them for
the next ſeven years as ever had been in any former times, what can be
imagined therefore, beſides the inſtigation of Satan, that either envied at
the proſperity of the Church of God here ſeated, or elſe fearing leſt
the power of the Lord Jeſus, that had overthrown his Kingdome in other parts
of the World, ſhould do the like here, and ſo the ſtone taken out of the
Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain without hands, ſhould become a great Mountain it ſelf, and fill
the <pb n="11" facs="tcp:171788:15"/> whole earth, no cauſe of provocation being given by
the Engliſh; For once before this in the year 1671 the Devill, who was a
Murderer from the beginning, had ſo filled the heart of this ſalvage
Miſcreant with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and malice againſt the Engliſh, that he was ready to
break out into open war againſt the Inhabitants of <hi>Plimouth,</hi>
pretending ſome petite injuryes done him in his planting land, but when the
matter of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie came to be heard before diverſe of the
<hi>Maſſachuſets Colony,</hi> yea when he himſelf came to
<hi>Boſton,</hi> as it were referring his caſe to the Judgment of that
Colony, nothing of that nature could be made to appear, whereupon in way of
ſubmiſſion, he was of neceſſity by that evident conviction forced to
acknowledge that it was the naughtineſs of his own heart, that put him upon
that Rebellion, and nothing of any provocation from the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, and to a

not treſpaſs upon the Indians, did at their own coſt ſet up a very

the Indians, and payed due damage if at any time any unruly horſe or other
beaſts brake in and treſpaſſed. And for diverſe years laſt paſt
(that all occaſion of offence in that reſpect might be prevented) the
Engliſh agreed with <hi>Philip</hi> and his, for a certain ſum yearly to

            <p>Yet did this treacherous and perfidious Caitiffe ſtill harbour
the ſame or more miſchievous thoughts againſt the Engliſh then ever
before, and hath been ſince that time plotting with all the Indians round
about to make a general inſurrection againſt the Engliſh in all the
Colonyes; which as ſome priſoners lately brought in have confeſſed,

               </gap>ſh,
and hath continued to this day a faithfull and reſolute Souldier in their
quarrel.</p>
            <p>That the Indians had a Conſpiracy amongſt themſelves to
riſe againſt the Engliſh, is confirmed by ſome of the Indians about
<hi>Hadly,</hi> although the plot was not come to maturity when <hi>Philip</hi>
began, the ſpecial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God therein over ruling the Contrivers: For
when the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the troubles firſt was reported from
<hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> many of the Indians were in a kind of a Maze, not knowing
well what to doe, ſometimes ready to ſtand for the Engliſh, as formerly
they had been wont to doe; ſometimes inclining to ſtrike in with
<hi>Philip</hi> (which at the laſt they generally did) which if it had been
foreſeen, much of that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief might have been prevented that fell out in
ſeveral places, more by perfidious and treacherous dealing then any other
wayes: the Engliſh never imagining that after ſo many obliging
kindneſſes received from them by the Indians, beſides their many
engagements and proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of friendſhip, as formerly, they would
have been ſo ungratefull, perfideouſly falſe and cruel as they have
ſince proved.</p>
            <p>The occaſion of <hi>Philips</hi> ſo ſudden taking up armes
the laſt year was this, There was one <hi>John Sauſaman</hi> a very cunning
and plauſible Indian well skilled in the Engliſh language, and bred up in
the profeſſion of Chriſtian Religion, imployed as a Schoolmaſter at
<hi>Natick,</hi> the Indian Town, who upon ſome miſdemeanour fled from his
place to <hi>Philip,</hi> by whom he was entertained in the room and office of
a Secretary, and his chief Counſellor, whome he truſted with all his
affairs and ſecret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels: But afterwards, whither upon the ſting of
his own Conſcience; or by the frequent Sollicitations of Mr. <hi>Eliot,</hi>
that had known him from a childe, and inſtructed him in the principles of our
Religion, who was often laying before him the heinous ſin of his apoſtacy,
and returning back to his old vomit, he was at laſt prevailed with to
forſake <hi>Philip,</hi> and return back to the Chriſtian Indians at
<hi>Natick,</hi> where he was baptized manifeſting publick Repentance for all
his former offences, <pb n="15" facs="tcp:171788:17"/> and made a ſerious Profeſſion
of the Chriſtian Religion: and did apply himſelf to Preach to the Indians,
wherein he was better gifted then any other of the Indian Nation; ſo as he
was obſerved to conforme more to the Engliſh manners then any other Indian:
yet having occaſion to go up with ſome others of his Country men to
Namasket; whither for the advantage of Fiſhing, or ſome ſuch occaſion,
it matters not; being there not far from <hi>Philips Country,</hi> he had
occaſion to be much in the Company of <hi>Philips Indians,</hi> and of
<hi>Philip</hi> himſelf: by which means he diſcerned by ſeveral
circumſtances, that the Indians were plotting anew againſt us; the which
out of faithfulneſs to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Sauſaman</hi>
informed the Governour of, adding alſo, that if it were known that he
revealed it, he knew they would preſently kill him. There appearing ſo many
concurrent teſtimonies from others, making it the more probable, that there
was a certain truth in the information; ſome inquiry was made into the
buſineſs, by examining <hi>Philip</hi> himſelf, &amp; ſeveral of his
Indians, who although they would own nothing; yet could not free themſelves
from juſt ſuſpicion; <hi>Philip</hi> therefore ſoon after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
the ſaid <hi>Sauſamans</hi> death, which was ſtrangely diſcovered;
not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it was ſo cunningly effected, for they that murdered him
met him upon the Ice on a great Pond, and preſently after they had knocked
him down, put him under the Ice, yet leaving his Gun and his Hat upon the Ice,
that it might be thought he fell in accidentally through the Ice and was
drowned: but being miſſed by his friends, who finding his Hat and his Gun,
they were thereby led to the place, where his body was found under the Ice:
when they took him up to bury him, ſome of his friends, ſpecially one
<hi>David</hi> obſerved ſome bruiſes about his Head, which made them
ſuſpect he was firſt knocked down, before he was put into the water,
however, they buried him near about the place where he was found, without
making any further inquiry at preſent: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs <hi>David</hi> his
friend, reported theſe things to ſome Engliſh at Taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton (a Town not far
from <hi>Namasket</hi>) it occaſioned the Governour to inquire further into
the buſineſs, wiſely conſidering, that as <hi>Sauſaman</hi> had told
him, that if it were known, that he had revealed any of their plots, they would
murder him for his pains: wherefore by ſpecial War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant the body of
<hi>Sauſaman</hi> being digged again out of his Grave, it was very apparent
that he had been killed and not drowned. And by a ſtrange providence, an
Indian was found, that by accident ſtanding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen upon a Hill, had ſeen
them murdering the ſaid <hi>Sauſaman,</hi> but dir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t never reveal it for fear of loſing his own life
likewiſe, until he was called to the Court at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> or before
the Governour, where he plainly <pb n="16" facs="tcp:171788:18"/> confeſſed what he had
ſeen. The Murderers being apprehended, were convicted by his undeniable
Teſtimony, and other remarkable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and ſo were all put to
death, being but three in number; the laſt of them confeſſed immediately
before his death, that his Father (one of the Councellers and ſpecial Friends
of <hi>Philip</hi>) was one of the two that murdered <hi>Sauſaman,</hi>
himſelf only looking on. This was done at <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth Court,</hi> held in
<hi>June</hi> 1675. inſomuch that <hi>Philip</hi> apprehending the danger his
own head was in next, never uſed any further means to clear himſelf from
what was like to be laid to his charge, either about his plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt
the Engliſh, nor yet about <hi>Sauſamans</hi> death: but by keeping his men
continually about him in Arms, and gathering what Strangers he could to joyn
with him, marching up and down conſtantly in Arms, both all the while the
Court ſat, as well as afterwards; the Engliſh of <hi>Plimouth</hi> hearing
of all this, yet took no further notice, then only to order a Military Watch in
all the adjacent Towns, hoping that <hi>Philip</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf not
likely to be Arraigned by Order of the ſaid Court, the preſent Cloud might
blow over, as ſome others of like nature had done before; but in
concluſion, the matter proved otherwiſe, for <hi>Philip</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his
Strength daily increaſing, by the flocking of Neighbour-Indians unto him, and
ſending over their Wives and Children to the <hi>Narhagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets</hi> for
ſecurity (as they uſe to do when they intend War with any of their Enemies)
Immediately they began to Alarm the Engliſh at <hi>Swanzy</hi> (the next Town
to <hi>Philips</hi> Country) as it were daring the Engliſh to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, at
laſt their inſolencies grew to ſuch an height, that they begin not only
to uſe threatning words to the Engliſh, but alſo to kill their Cattle and
rifle their houſes; whereat an Engliſh-man was ſo provoked, that he let
fly a Gun at an Indian, but did only wound, not kill him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the
Indians immediately began to kill all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> they could, ſo
as on the 24<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1675. was the Alarm of War firſt
ſounded in <hi>Plimouth Colony,</hi> when eight or nine of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> were ſlain in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Swanzy:</hi> They firſt
making a ſhot at a company of <hi>Engliſh</hi> as they returned from the
Aſſembly where they were met in way of Humiliation that day, whereby they
killed one and wounded others, and then like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe at the ſame time, they
ſlew two Men on the High-way, ſent to call a Surgeon, and barbarouſly the
ſame day murdered ſix men in and about a dwelling Houſe in an other part
of the Town, all which outrages were committed ſo ſuddenly, that the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> had no time to make any reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: For on the
14<hi>th.</hi> of the ſame Month, beſides endeavours uſed by Mr.
<hi>Brown</hi> of <hi>Swanzy</hi> one of the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> of
<hi>Plimouth</hi> Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, an amicable Letter was ſent from the
Council of <hi>Plimouth</hi> to <hi>Philip</hi> 
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:171788:18"/> ſhewing
their diſlike of his practiſes, and adviſing him to diſmiſs his
ſtrange Indians, and not ſuffer himſelf to be abuſed by falſe
Reports, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them that intended him no hurt, but no anſwer could be
obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, otherwiſe then threatning of War, which it was hoped might have
been prevented, as heretofore it had been, when things ſeemed to look with as
bad face as then they did. However the Governour and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of
<hi>Plimouth,</hi> underſtanding that <hi>Philip</hi> continued in his
reſolution, &amp; manifeſted no inclination to peace, they immediately
ſent up what Forces they could to ſecure the Towns thereabouts, and make
reſiſtance as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion might be, and alſo diſpatched away
Meſſengers to the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſets</hi> Governour and Council,
letting them know the ſtate of things about <hi>Mount-Hope:</hi> and
deſiring their ſpeedy aſſiſtance: upon which care was immediately
taken with all expedition to ſend ſuch ſupplyes as were deſired: But in
the mean time two Meſſengers were diſpatched to <hi>Philip,</hi> to try
whether he could not be diverted from his bloudy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, ſo to have
prevented the miſchief ſince fallen out, hoping, that as once before,
<hi>viz. Anno</hi> 1671. by their mediation, a ſtop was put to the like
Tragedy; ſo the preſent warre might by the ſame meanes have been now
turned aſide: For in the ſaid year <hi>Philip</hi> had fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mly engaged himſelf, when he was at
<hi>Boſton,</hi> not to quarrel with <hi>Plimouth</hi> untill he had firſt
addreſſed himſelf to the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> for advice and
approbation: But the two Meſſengers aforeſaid, finding the men ſlain in
the Roade <hi>June</hi> 24. as they were going for the Surgeon, apprehended it
not ſafe to proceed any further, conſidering alſo, that a peace now could
not honourably be concluded after ſuch barbarous outrages committed upon
ſome of the neighbour Colony: Wherefore returning with all ſpeed to
<hi>Boſton,</hi> the <hi>Maſſachuſet</hi> Forces were diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away with all immaginable haſt, as the ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gent of the matter did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, ſome of them being then upon, or
ready for their March, the reſt were ordered to follow after, as they could
be raiſed. The ſending forth of which, becauſe it was the firſt
engagement in any warlike pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations againſt the Indians, ſhall be more
particularly declared.</p>
            <p>On the 26<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>June</hi> a Foot-Company under Capt.
<hi>Daniel Henchman,</hi> with a Troop under Capt. <hi>Thomas Prentice,</hi>
were ſent out of <hi>Boſton</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Mount-Hope;</hi> it being late
in the afternoon before they began to march, the central Eclipſe of the Moon
in <hi>Capric.</hi> hapned in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before they came up to
<hi>Naponſet River,</hi> about twenty miles from <hi>Boſton,</hi> which
occaſioned them to make an halt, for a little repaſt, till the moon
recovered her light again. Some melancholy Fancyes would not be perſwaded,
but that the Eclipſe falling out at that inſtant of time, 
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:171788:19"/> was ominous, conceiving alſo that in the centre of the
Moon they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned an unuſual black ſpot, not a little reſembling the
ſcalp of an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian:</hi> As ſome others not long before, imagined they
ſaw the form of an <hi>Indian Bow,</hi> accounting that likewiſe ominous
(although the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief following was done by Guns, not by Bows) both the one
and the other, might rather have thought of what <hi>Marcus Craſſus</hi>
the <hi>Roman General,</hi> going forth with an A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

replied to a private Souldier, that would have diſſwaded him from mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
that time, becauſe of an Eclipſe of the Moon in <hi>Capricorn [That he was
more afraid of Sagitarius then of Capricornus]</hi> meaning the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of the
<hi>Parthians</hi> (accounted very good Archers) from whom as things then fell
out, was his greateſt danger. But after the Moon had waded through the dark
ſhadow of the Earth, and borrowed her Light again, by the help thereof, the
two Companies marched on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Woodcocks</hi> Houſe, thirty miles from
<hi>Boſton,</hi> where they arrived next morning; and there retarded their
motion till the afternoon, in hope of being overtaken by a Company of
<hi>Volunteers,</hi> under the Command of Captain <hi>Samuel Moſely,</hi>
which accordingly came to paſs, ſo as on <hi>June</hi> 28<hi>th.</hi> they
all arrived at <hi>Swanzy,</hi> where by the advice of Captain
<hi>Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> the Commander in chief of <hi>Plimouth Forces,</hi> they
were removed to the Head-Quarters; which for that time were appointed at Mr.
<hi>Miles</hi> his houſe, the Miniſter of <hi>Swanzy,</hi> within a quarter
of a mile of the Bridge, leading into <hi>Philips Lands.</hi> They arriving
there ſome little time before night, twelve of the Troop unwilling to looſe
time paſſed over the Bridge, for diſcovery into the Enemies Territories,
where they found the rude welcome of eight or ten Indians firing upon them out
of the Buſhes, killing one <hi>William Hammond,</hi> wounding Corporal
<hi>Belcher,</hi> his Horſe being alſo ſhot down under him; the reſt of

pitching in a Barricado about Mr. <hi>Miles</hi> his houſe. The Enemy thought
to have braved it out by a bold aſſauld or two at the firſt; but their
hearts ſoon began to fail them when they perceived the
<hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> &amp; <hi>Plimouth Forces</hi> both engaged

and nine or ten of them ſhewing themſelves on this ſide the Bridge: our
Horſemen with the whole body of the Privateers under Captain
<hi>Moſely,</hi> not at all daunted by ſuch kind of Alarms, nor willing
ſo to looſe the Bridge, ran violently down upon them over the ſaid
Bridge, purſuing them a mile and quarter on the other ſide: Enſigne

               <hi>Savage,</hi> that young Martial Spark, ſcarce twenty
years of age, had at that time one bullet lodged in his Thigh, another ſhot
through the brims of his Hat, by ten or twelve of the Enemy diſcharging upon
him toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, while he boldly held up his Colours in the Front of his Company:
but the weather not ſuffering any further action at that time, thoſe that
were thus far advanced, were compelled to retreat back to the main Guard,
having firſt made a ſhot upon the <hi>Indians</hi> as they ran away into a
Swamp nearby, whereby they killed five or ſix of them, as was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
ſoon after at <hi>Narhaganſet:</hi> This reſolute charge of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces upon the Enemy made them quit their place on
<hi>Mount-Hope</hi> that very night, where <hi>Philip</hi> was never ſeen
after; till the next year, when he was by a divine Mandate ſent back: there
to receive the reward of his wickedneſs where he firſt began his

over the <hi>Maſſachuſet Forces,</hi> being come up with other Supplies
about ſix a clock over night) the whole Body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to march into
<hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> and there beat up the Enemys quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or give him
Battle, if he durſt abide it: but the weather being doubtful, our Forces did
not march till near noon, about which time they ſet out, with a Troop of
Horſe in each wing, to prevent the danger of the Enemies Ambuſcadoes; after
they had marched about a mile &amp; and half, they paſſed by ſome
Houſes newly burned: not far of one of them they found a Bible newly torn,
and the leaves ſcattered about by the Enemy, in hatred of our Religion
therein revealed; two or three miles further they came up with ſome Heads,
Scalps, and Hands cut off from the bodys of ſome of the Engliſh, and
ſtuck upon Poles near the Highway, in that barbarous and inhumane manner
bidding us Defyance, the Commander in chief giving Order that thoſe monuments
of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies cruelty ſhould be taken down, and buried: the whole body of
the Forces ſtill marched on, two miles further, where they found divers
Wigwams of the Enemy, amongſt which were many things ſcattered up and down,
arguing the haſty flight of the Owners; half a mile further, as they
paſſed on through many Fields of ſtately Corn, they found
<hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips</hi> own Wigwam; every place giving them to perceive the Enemies
haſty departure from thence; after they had marched two miles further they
came to the Sea ſide, yet in all this time meeting with no Indians, nor any
ſign of them, unleſs of their flight to ſome other places. The ſeaſon
like to prove very tempeſtuous, and rainy, Captain <hi>Cudworth</hi> with
ſome of the men of <hi>Plimouth</hi> paſſed over to
<hi>Road-Iſland.</hi> The Forces under Major <hi>Savage</hi> were forced to
abide all night in the open Field, without any ſhelter, notwithſtanding the
abundance of rain that <pb n="20" facs="tcp:171788:20"/> fell, and in the morning,
deſpairing to meet with any enemy on <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> they retreated back
to their Quarters at <hi>Swanzy,</hi> in the way meeting with many Indian dogs,

            <p>About ten a clock the next morning, <hi>July.</hi> 4. Capt.
<hi>Henchman</hi> after a long and tedious March, came to the Head-Quarters,
and informed that he came upon a place where the enemy had newly been that
night, but were eſcaped out of his reach: But that night before they were
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined of any other motion, Capt. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> came up from
<hi>Boſton</hi> with new Orders for them to paſs into
<hi>Narrhaganſet,</hi> to treat with the Sachems there, and if it might be,
to prevent their joyning with <hi>Philip.</hi> Capt. <hi>Cudworth,</hi> by this
time was come up to the Head Quarters, having left a Gariſon of fourty men
upon <hi>Mount-Hope</hi> Neck. The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was ſpent in conſultation
how to carry on the Treaty; it was then reſolved, that they ſhould goe to
make a peace with a Sword in their <pb n="21" facs="tcp:171788:20"/> hands, having no ſmal
ground of ſuſpition that the ſaid <hi>Narhaganſets</hi> might joyn with
the enemy wherefore, they thought it neceſſary to carry all the
<hi>Maſſachuſet</hi> Forces over into the <hi>Narhaganſet</hi> Country,
to fight them if there ſhould be need, Capt. <hi>Moſely</hi> paſſed
over by water to attend Capt. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> in his diſpatch; the
other Companys with the Troopers riding round about: as they paſſed they
found the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians in <hi>Pomhams</hi> Country (next adjoyning to
<hi>Philips</hi> Borders) all fled, and their Wigwams without any people in
them.</p>
            <p>After they came to the <hi>Narhaganſet</hi> Sachems, three or
four dayes were ſpent in a treaty, after which a peace was concluded on
ſundry Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles between the Meſſengers of <hi>Connecticut</hi> Colony
(who were ordered to meet with thoſe of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi>) and
the Commanders of the Forces ſent againſt <hi>Philip:</hi> Hoſtages were
alſo given by the ſaid <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haganſets</hi> for the performance of the
agreement. A Copy of the ſaid Agreement, and the Articles on which a Peace
was concluded, here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. It being alwayes underſtood, that
<hi>Plimouth</hi> Colony was included in the ſaid Agreement, although their
Forces were not then preſent, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained at home neer the enemies Borders,
to ſecure their Towns, and oppoſe <hi>Philip</hi> as there might be
occaſion, if he offered to make any new attempt in the mean time.</p>

            <p>During this Treaty of Peace with the Narhaganſets, Captain
<hi>Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> with the Forces of <hi>Plimouth</hi> under his Command,
found ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do nearer home, though of another nature as it proved,
<hi>ſc.</hi> to make War whilſt the other were (as they thought) making
peace: in the firſt place therefore he diſpatched Captain <hi>Fuller</hi>)
joyning Lieuten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant <hi>Church</hi> together with him in Commiſſion) with
fifty in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to <hi>Pocaſſet,</hi> on the ſame account, as the
other went to Narhaganſer; either to conclude a Peace with them, if they
would continue Friends, and give Hoſtages for the confirmation thereof, or
fight them if they ſhould declare themſelves Enemies, and joyn with
<hi>Philip;</hi> himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to draw down his Forces to
<hi>Rehoboth,</hi> to be ready for a ſpeedy March to Taunton, and ſo down
into the other ſide of the Country upon the news that ſome of the Enemy
were burning and ſpoiling of <hi>Middleburrough</hi> and <hi>Dartmouth,</hi>
two ſmall Villages lying in the way <pb n="24" facs="tcp:171788:22"/> betwixt
<hi>Pocaſſet</hi> and <hi>Plimouth.</hi> Upon thurſday <hi>July</hi> 7.
Captain <hi>Fuller</hi> with Captain <hi>Church</hi> went into
<hi>Pocaſſet</hi> to ſeek after the Enemy, or elſe as occaſion might
ſerve, to treat with thoſe Indians at <hi>Pocaſſet,</hi> with whom Mr.
<hi>Church</hi> was very well acquainted; alwayes holding good
cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with them: After they had ſpent that day and moſt of the
night, in traverſing the ſaid <hi>Pocaſſet Neck,</hi> and Watching all
night in an Houſe which they found there, yet could hear no tidings of any
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians; inſomuch that Captain <hi>Fuller</hi> began to be weary of his
deſign: Mr. <hi>Church</hi> in the mean while aſſuring him that they
ſhould finde Indians before it were long: yet for greater expedition they
divided their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, Captain <hi>Fuller</hi> taking down toward the
Sea-ſide, where it ſeems after ſome little skirmiſhing with them,
wherein one man only received a ſmall Wound, he either ſaw or heard too
many Indians for himſelf and his Company to deal with, which m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>de him and them betake themſelves to
an Houſe near the Water-ſide, from whence they were fetched off by a Sloop
before night to <hi>Road-Iſland.</hi> Captain <hi>Church</hi> (for ſo may
he well be ſtiled after this time) marched further into the Neck, imagining
that if there were Indians in the Neck, they ſhould finde them about a
peas-field not farr off: as ſoon as ever they came near the ſaid field he
eſpyed two Indians in the peaſe, who alſo had at the ſame time eſpyed
him, and preſently making ſome kind of ſhout, a great number of Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
came about the field, purſuing the ſaid Capt. <hi>Church</hi> and his men
in great numbers to the ſea ſide: there being not above fifteen with
<hi>Church,</hi> yet ſeven or eight ſcore of the Indians purſuing after
them. Now was a fit time for this young Captain and his ſmall Company to
handſel their valour upon this great rout of Indians, juſt ready to devour
them: But victory ſtands no more in the number of Souldiers, then Verity in
the plurality of voyces: And although ſome of theſe fifteen had ſcarce
courage enough for themſelves, yet their Captain had enough for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and ſome to ſpare for his friends, which he there had an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of
improving to the full. When he ſaw the hearts of any of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to
fail, he would bid them be of good Courage and fight ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and
(poſſibly by ſome divine impreſſion upon his heart) aſſured them
not a bullet of the enemy ſhould hurt any one of them; which one of the
Company, more diſmayed then the reſt, could hardly believe, till he ſaw
the proof of it in his own perſon, for the Captain perceiving the man was
notable to fight, made him gather Rocks together for a kind of ſhelter and
Baricadoe for the reſt, that muſt either of neceſſity fight or fall by
the enemyes. It chanced as this faint-hearted ſouldier had a flat ſtone in
his armes, and was carying it to the ſhelter that he was making 
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:171788:22"/> upon the Bank, a bullet of the Enemy was thus warded from
his Body by which he muſt elſe have periſhed, which experience put new
life into him, ſo as he followed his buſineſs very manfully afterward,
inſomuch that they defended themſelves under ſmall defence haſtily made
up all that afternoon, not one being either ſlain or wounded, yet it was
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known that they killed at leaſt fifteen of their Enemies: and at
the laſt, when they had ſpent all their Amunition, and made their Guns
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviceable by often firing, they were fetched all off by Capt.
<hi>Goldings</hi> Sloop, and carried ſafe to <hi>Road-Iſland</hi> in
deſpight of all their Enemies; yea, ſuch was the bold and undaunted courage
of this Champion Capt. <hi>Church,</hi> that he was not willing to leave any
token behind of their flying for want of courage, that in the face of his
Enemies he went back to fetch his Hat, which he had left at a Spring, whether
the extream heat of the weather, and his labour in fighting had cauſed him to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair for the quenching of his thirſt an hour or two before. It ſeems in
the former part of the ſame day, five men coming from <hi>Road-Iſland,</hi>
to look up their Cattle upon <hi>Pocaſſet Neck,</hi> were aſſaulted by
the ſame <hi>Indians,</hi> and one of the five was Capt. <hi>Churches</hi>
Servant, who had his Leg broke in the Skirmiſh, the reſt hardly eſcaping
with their lives: this was the firſt time that ever any miſchief was done
by the <hi>Indians</hi> upon <hi>Pocaſſet Neck.</hi> Thoſe of
<hi>Road-Iſland</hi> were hereby Alarmed to look to themſelves, as well as
the reſt of the Engliſh of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> or the
<hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſets Colony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Aſſault rather heightened and increaſed then daunted
the courage of Capt. <hi>Church;</hi> for not making a cowardly flight, but a
fair retreat, which providence offered him by the Sloop aforeſaid, after his
Amunition was ſpent, he did not ſtay long at <hi>Road-Iſland,</hi> but
haſted over to the <hi>Mattachuſet Forces,</hi> and borrowing three files
of Men of Capt. <hi>Hench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> with his Lieutenant: Mr. <hi>Church</hi> and
he returned again to <hi>Pocaſſet,</hi> where they had another skirmiſh
with the Enemy, wherein ſome few of them fourteen or fifteen were ſlain,
which ſtruck ſuch a terror into <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> that he be
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ook himſelf to the Swamps about
<hi>Pocaſſet,</hi> where he lay hid till the return of the reſt of the
Forces from the <hi>Narhaganſets,</hi> like a wild Boar kept at a Bay by this
ſmall party till more hands came up.</p>
            <p>Thus were the <hi>Plimouth Forces</hi> buſied, during the time
of the Treaty with the <hi>Narhaganſets,</hi> which being iſſued as it
was.</p>
            <p>On Friday <hi>July</hi> 15. Our Forces Marched for, and araived at

               <hi>Pocaſſet,</hi>
eighteen miles from <hi>Taunton;</hi> they marched next day twelve miles to an
Houſe at <hi>Matapoiſet</hi> (a ſmall Neck of Land in the bottome 
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:171788:23"/> of <hi>Taunton Bay,</hi> in the mid-way between
<hi>Mount-hope</hi> and <hi>Pocaſſet Neck</hi>) from whence they marched
for <hi>Taunton. July</hi> 17. whither after a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious March of twenty miles
they came in the evening, and found the People generally gathered into eight
Gariſon Houſes:</p>
            <p>On Monday <hi>July</hi> 18. they Marched eighteen miles before
they could reach the Swamp where the Enemy was lodged; as ſoon as ever they
came to the place, <hi>Plimouth Forces</hi> being now joyned with them, our
Souldiers reſolutely entred in amongſt the Enemies, who took the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the thick under-wood, to make a ſhot at them that firſt entred whereby
five were killed outright, ſeven more wounded, ſome of whoſe wounds
proved mortal: Af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er the firſt
ſhot, the Enemy preſently reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red deeper into the Swamp, deſerting their
Wagwams (about an hundred in all) newly made of green Barks, ſo as they would
not burn: in one of them they found an old man, who confeſſed that
<hi>Philip</hi> had been lately there: having ſpent ſome time in
ſearching the Swamp, and tired themſelves to no purpoſe, yet it was
ſaid one half hour more would have at that time utterly ſubdued
<hi>Philip</hi> and all his power. The Commander in chief, (night drawing on
apace) not thinking it ſafe to tarry longer in ſo dangerous a place, (where
every one was in as much danger of his fellows as of his foes, being ready to
fire upon every Buſh they ſee move (ſuppoſing <hi>Indians</hi> were
there) ordered a Retreat to be ſounded, that they might have time to
diſpoſe of their dead and wounded men, which accordingly was attended:
<hi>Plimouth Forces</hi> who had entred in the rear, retreating in the front.
It was judged that the Enemy being by this means brought into a Pound, it would
be no hard matter to deal with them, and that it would be needleſs charge to
keep ſo many Companies of Souldiers together to wait upon ſuch an
inconſiderable Enemy, now almoſt as good as taken: whereupon moſt of the
Companies belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> were drawn off, only Capt. <hi>Henchman</hi> with

experience how dangerous it is to fight in ſuch diſmal Woods, when their
eyes were muffled with the leaves, and their heads pinnioned with the thick
boughs of the trees, as their feet were continually ſhackled with the roots
ſpreading every way in thoſe boggy Woods. It is ill fighting with a wilde
Beaſt in his own den. They reſolved therefore to ſtarve them out of the
Swamp, where they knew full well they could not long ſubſiſt: To that end
they began to build a Fort, as it were to beleaguer the enemy, and prevent his
eſcape out of the place, where they thought they had him faſt enough.
<hi>Philip</hi> in the mean time was not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of what was doing without,
and was ready therein to read his own doome, ſo as if he tarryed much longer
there, he knew he ſhould fall into their hands from whom he could expect no
mercy: The caſe being therefore deſperate, he reſolved with an hundred or
two of his beſt fighting men to make an eſcape by the Water, all

were like to be rather bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome then ſerviceable were left behind, who

<hi>Philips</hi> eſcape thus from <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſet</hi> could not long be

who as ſoon as he could get over with ſix files of men (rowing hard all or

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:171788:24"/> The <hi>Mohegins</hi> with the men of <hi>Rehoboth,</hi>

               </gap>w about thirty of them, took much

Capt. <hi>Henchman</hi> came not up to them (purſuing them only by the Track)
till the Skirmiſh was over, and having marched twenty two miles that day was
not well able to go any further that night; on the other hand, the Forces that
came from <hi>Rehoboth</hi> and that belonged to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> having left
their horſes three miles off could not goe back to fetch them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much

them in the morning, returned back the next day, leaving Capt <hi>Henchman</hi>
with his ſix Files, and the <hi>Mohegins</hi> to purſue the Chaſe to
<hi>Nipſatchet,</hi> which he did the next morning. Capt. <hi>Henchman,</hi>
that he might the better engage the <hi>Mohegins</hi> to march with him thirty
miles gave them half his proviſion, and was himſelf recruited again by the
care of Capt. <hi>Edmunds</hi> of <hi>Providence,</hi> &amp; Leiutenant

                  </gap>pmuck</hi> Forts. Mr. <hi>Newman</hi>
the Miniſter of <hi>Rehoboth</hi> deſerved not a little Commendation for
exciting his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and friends to purſue thus far after
<hi>Philip,</hi> animating of them by his own example and preſence: But what
the reaſon was why <hi>Philip</hi> was followed no further, it is better to
ſuſpend, then too critically to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. This is now the third time when a
good opportunity of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the Rebellion of the Indians, was put
into the hands of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh; but time and chance hapneth to all men, ſo
that the moſt likely meanes are often fruſtrated of their deſired end.
All humane endeavours ſhall arive at no other ſucceſs, then the Counſel
of God hath preordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that no fleſh might glory in their own Wiſdome,
but give unto God the praiſe of all their Suceſſes, and quietly bear
whatever Miſcariages he hath ordered to befall them. It appears by the
iſſue of theſe things, that although this wound was not incurable, yet
much more bloud muſt be taken away before it could be healed. But by this
means <hi>Philip</hi> eſcaped away to the Weſtward, kindling the flame of
Warre in all the Weſtern plantations of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi>
Colony wherever he came, ſo that by this fatal accident, the fire that was in
a likely way to be extinguiſhed, as ſoon almoſt' as it began, did on the
ſudden break out through the whole Jurisdiction of the
<hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> both Eaſtward and Weſtward, endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering
alſo the neighbour Colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> which hath alſo
ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſomewhat by the ſury of this Flame, though not conſiderable
to what the other Colonyes have undergone.</p>
            <p>While things after this manner proceeded in and about the Colony
of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> the Commiſſioners of the reſt of the Colonyes were
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting <pb n="29" facs="tcp:171788:24"/> and adviſing what was to be done for
preventing the miſchief threatned from ſpreading any further, fearing (as
indeed there was too much cauſe) that although <hi>Philip</hi> only appeared
to make the firſt attempt yet more either already were, or ſoon might be be
perſwaded to joyn with him in acting this bloudy Tragedy.</p>
            <p>It hath been already declared what hath been done for the
ſecuring of the <hi>Narhaganſets,</hi> thoſe that were ſent as
Meſſengers on that errand, alwayes reported that the elder people were in
appearance, not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to peace, but ſeemed very deſirous
thereof, inſomuch as their two eldeſt Sachems expreſſed much joy when
it was concluded; but as ſince hath appeared, all this was but to gain time,
and cover their treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous intents and purpoſes, that they might in the
next Spring fall upon the Engliſh plantations all at once, as ſome
priſoners lately brought in have owned and confeſſed; nor have any of
thoſe Indians with whom the preſent War hath been, ever regarded any
agreements of peace made with the Engliſh, further then out of neceſſity
and ſlaviſh fear they were compelled thereunto, as may be ſeen by the
Records of the united Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes from the year 1643 to the preſent time,
notwithſtanding all their fair pretences, for <hi>Ninigret,</hi> the old
Sachem of the <hi>Narhaganſets,</hi> who alone of all the reſt of that
Country Sachems diſowned the preſent war, and refuſed to have any hand
therein, yet was it proved to his face be-before the Commiſſioners, in the
years 1646 and 1647, that he had threatned they would carry on the war
againſt the <hi>Mohegins,</hi> whatever were the mind of the
Commiſſioners, and that they would kill the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Cattle, and heap
them up as high as their Wigwams, and that an Engliſh man ſhould not ſtir
out of his doors to piſs, but they would kill him; all which he could not
deny; yet did this old Fox make many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of peace; when the dread of
the Engliſh ever ſince the <hi>Pequod-war</hi> moved him thereunto;
foreſeeing as he is ſaid to have told his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, that they would all
be ruined if they made War with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as is ſince come to
paſs. However the good hand of God was ſeen in ſo ordering things, that
the <hi>Narhaganſets</hi> were for the preſent reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from breaking
out into open Hoſtility againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> at that time when
<hi>Philip</hi> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>gan which if they
had then done, according to the eye of reaſon, it would have been very
difficult, if poſſible for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to have ſaved any of
their inland plantations from being utterly deſtroyed. Thus hath God in his
Wiſdome ſuffered ſo much of the rage of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to be let looſe
againſt his people here, as to become a Scourge unto them, that by the wrath
of men, praiſe might be yeilded to his holy Name, yet hath he in his abundant
goodneſs reſtrained the remainder that it ſhould not conſume.</p>

providence) near or next unto him, being a man of undaunted courage
(notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his own Arm was broken with a Bullet) yet with great
nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and agility of body, diſmounting himſelf, ſpeedily mounted
his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon his own Horſe, himſelf getting upon an other, whoſe
Maſter was killed, by which means they both eſcaped, and were afterwards
cured. Much ado had thoſe that were left alive to recover
<hi>Brookefield,</hi> which in all probability they had never done (the common
Road being way laid with Indians on every ſide as was afterwards known) had
it not been for one well acquainted with thoſe Woods, who led them in a by
path, by which means they got thither, a little before the Indians, who quickly
came flocking into the Town, with full intent to deſtroy it with fire and
Sword. But by ſpecial providence the Inhabitants were all gathered to the
principal houſe of the Village (there being ſcarce twenty in the Town)
before the barbarons Miſcrean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

came upon them, immediately ſetting fire upon all the dwelling houſes, with
moſt of the other Buildings in the Town ſave that one into which the
Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants were retired, the which they ſeveral times attempted to born,
but were almoſt miraculouſly defeated of their purpoſe by the immediate
hand of God. In the Mount of the Lord it ſhall be ſeen. For when they had
for two dayes aſſaulted that poor handfull of helpleſs people, both night
and day pouring in ſhot upon them inceſſantly with gunns, and alſo
thruſting poles with Fire-brands, and rags dipt in brimſtone ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the
ends of them to fire the houſe.</p>
            <p>At laſt they uſed this deviliſh Stratagem, to fill a Cart
with hemp, flax and other combuſtible matter, and ſo thruſting it
backward with poles ſpliced together a great length, after they had kindled
it; But as ſoon as it had begun to take fire, a Storm of rain unexpectedly
falling, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

out the Fire, or elſe all the poor people, about ſeventy ſouls, would
either have been conſumed by mercileſs flames, or elſe have fallen into
the hands of their cruel enemyes, like Wolves continually yelling and gaping
for their prey.</p>
            <p>Thus was that diſtreſſed Company ſtrangely delivered, who
have for ever cauſe to ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Bleſſed be the
Lord, who hath not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us a prey to their teeth, our ſoul is eſcaped as
a bird out of the ſnare of the Fowlers, the ſnare is broken and we are

therewith, which though it did not find him in the Town, yet overtook him
before he had gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove four or five miles from the place: whereupon,
conceiving it more needful to ſuccour <hi>Brookfield</hi> in ſo eminent

courſe and marched di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly thither, being about thirty miles diſtant when

it was dark, or elſe in probability they had all periſhed before the relief

               </gap>kewiſe in bringing in the ſaid Major ſo ſafely,

<hi>Indians</hi> had ſubtilly contrived to cut off all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief ſent, before
it could come at them, by laying Ambuſhes, and placing their Scours, at two
or three miles diſtance round the Town: About an hundred of them were lodged
at an houſe not far off in the way toward <hi>Boſton,</hi> to cut off any
Succour that might come from thence: but it is ſuppoſed they were ſo
intenſe upon the Project they were about for firing the Houſe, conclud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>maimed and killed, as were

This Honoured Perſon Major <hi>Willard</hi> continued at <hi>Brookfield</hi>
after this famous exploit for the preſervation of the poor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged at
<hi>Brookfield,</hi> divers weeks to order ſuch Companies as were ſent up
that way for the ſecuring of the Plantations on that ſide of the Country;
and not long after he went himſelf alſo to <hi>Hadly</hi> upon the like
ſervice of the Country in the preſent War: But after ſome time ſpent in
thoſe parts, he returned back to his own place, to order the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of his
own Regiment, much needing his preſence, and leaving the Forces about
<hi>Hadly</hi> under the command of the Major of that Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But to return to what was in hand before, after the Indians
under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that ſuccours were come in to the beſeiged, they fired all
that they had left ſtanding for their own ſhelter while they had beſeiged
the place before mentioned, ran all away into their own dens, in the
neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring woods: however it was confeſſed by one of themſelves, that
the enemy had eighty of their men killed and wounded in this buſineſs. But
ere we paſs any further in purſuit of the Hiſtory of theſe matters, it
will not be amiſs to let the Reader underſtand the horrible perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and
treacherous dealing of theſe <hi>Nipnet Indians,</hi> who of all other had
the leaſt reaſon as to any pretence of injury, yet did moſt deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and barbarouſly joyn with <hi>Philip</hi> and his Indians, after they had

as the riſing of the <hi>Narhaganſets,</hi> and alſo had faithfully
promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not to meddle in the quarrel, as may more fully appear by the
Engagement under the hands of their Sachems, ſome time before Capt.
<hi>Hutchinſon</hi> and Capt. <hi>Wheeler</hi> were ſent up to them, which
by reaſon of the haſt and unskilfullneſs of the Meſſengers on that
behalf ſent, is not ſo fit for publick view: but the account of it from
their return, <pb n="35" facs="tcp:171788:27"/> under their hand and oath, <hi>July</hi>
24.75. when Leiut. <hi>Ephraim Gurtice</hi> ſpake with five of the
<hi>Nipnet</hi> Sachems, four too many to govern ſo ſmall a people, but
lying upon the head of the principal Indian Territoryes, they were divided into
ſo many ſmall partyes, two of whom, <hi>viz. Sam</hi> Sachem of
<hi>Weſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>um,</hi> and
<hi>Netaump</hi> were executed together afterward at <hi>Boſton.</hi> All of
them did at that time ſolemnly renew their Covenant and promiſe under their
hands to come to <hi>Boſton</hi> to ſpeak further with the Governour,
inſtead of which what they perfidiouſly did againſt Capt
<hi>Hutchinſon</hi> and others, hath already been declared.</p>
            <p>Upon the report of this ſad Diſaſter that befel the
Inhabitants of <hi>Brookefield,</hi> Forces were ſent up under the Command of
Capt. <hi>Lothrop</hi> and others, to purſue after thoſe Indians,
harbouring about thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and if it might be, to prevent them from
joyning with the Indians upon <hi>Connecticut River,</hi> who as yet had not
diſcovered themſelves as willing to eſpouſe <hi>Philips</hi>
intereſt, but rather made ſome ſemblance to the contrary. There was much
time ſpent by Major <hi>Willard,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Companyes of Souldiers
left under his command, about the <hi>Nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> Country, but all to no
purpoſe; for partly by the treachery of ſome of the Indians that came to
their aſſiſtance, that ſeemed to favour the Engliſh, but rather acted
in behalf of the enemy, partly by the ſubtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes of the enemyes
themſelves, who could eaſily by their ſcouts diſcern the approach of
our ſouldiers, and by the nimbleneſs of their feet eſcape them: our
Souldiers could never meet with any of them, but only by that means driving
them further Weſtward, they gathered all the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans they could to their
party about <hi>Pecomptuck,</hi> alias <hi>Dearfield, Swamſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot,</hi> and
<hi>Squakeag,</hi> where were ſome plantations of the Engliſh newly began,
whom they aſſaulted in the next place, and did what miſchief they could
upon them.</p>
            <p>It is here to be noted that although that worthy Patriot and
experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eneed Souldier Major <hi>Willard</hi> hearing of the diſtreſs of
<hi>Brookefield</hi> by ſome that were travelling to <hi>Connecticut</hi> was
the firſt that relieved the diſtreſſed people of <hi>Quabaog</hi> or
<hi>Brookefield,</hi> yet Major <hi>Pinehen</hi> of <hi>Springfield</hi> alſo
by accident hearing of their Calamity, had not only ſent word thereof to
<hi>Hartford</hi> (from whom he received a ſupply of five and twenty or
thirty ſouldiers under Capt. <hi>Wats</hi>) but did alſo ſend a Band of
men under Lieut. <hi>Cooper</hi> (who was afterwards villanouſly ſlain by
<hi>Springfield</hi> Indians) who with thoſe ſent from <hi>Hartford,</hi>
and ſome Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans belonging to <hi>Springfield</hi> (ſeemingly forward to
help the Engliſh) made up fourſcore or thereabouts; theſe marched down to
<hi>Brookefield</hi> the ſame day that Capt <hi>Lothrop</hi> and Capt.
<hi>Beers</hi> came up from the <pb n="36" facs="tcp:171788:28"/>
               <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> who having ſpent ſome time in ſearching the
woods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Springfield,</hi> and finding none of the Indians, did the
next day march up to a pluce called <hi>Meminimiſſet</hi> by the Indians,
where Capt. <hi>Hutchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and Capt. <hi>Wheeler</hi> were
aſſaulted, and finding no ſign of any Indians amongſt thoſe woods and
Swamps; the Company that came from <hi>Springfield,</hi> left the other
Souldiers (who returned to their Quarters at <hi>Brookefield</hi>) and went up
themſelves further northward, at leaſt twenty miles from the ſaid
<hi>Brookfield,</hi> and finding no track of Indians in all thoſe woods, they
returned back to <hi>Springfield,</hi> leaving enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the people of
<hi>Brookefield,</hi> and the gariſon there.</p>
            <p>By this it appears, that the Indians by this occaſion were
driven more weſtward into the woods between <hi>Hadly</hi> and
<hi>Squakheag.</hi> where they ſoon effected their deſign, <hi>viz.</hi> to
leaven the Indians on that ſide the Country with the ſame prejudice and
malice againſt the Engliſh, with which they themſelves were (though
without cauſe) imbittered; for in a few dayes the device took place amongſt
<hi>Hadly</hi> and <hi>Dearfield</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, and was preſently put in
execution by the ſaid Indians, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from the Engliſh and
aſſiſting <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Nipnets</hi> to ſpoile and
deſtroy all the towns weſtward, as ſoon after came to paſs: yet at the
firſt ſome of the <hi>Hadly</hi> Indians pretended real friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to
the Engliſh, and offered themſelves to fight againſt <hi>Philip,</hi> but
the <hi>Mohegin Indians</hi> that came afterward from <hi>Harford</hi> began to
ſuſpect the Treachery of the other, and told the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
plainly, that no good would be done, while any of that Company went along with
them in purſuit of the Enemy, for as was ſaid, they would alwayes give
ſome ſhout when they came near the Enemy, as if they ſhould thereby
wiſh them to look to themſelves; inſomuch that the ſaid <hi>Hadly
Indians</hi> fell into great ſuſpicion with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and for
a proof of their Fidelity, they were required to bring in their Arms to the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> but upon that motion they delayed a little, but that very
night they fled away from their Dwellings, which was in a Wooden Fortification,
within a mile of <hi>Hatfield,</hi> whereby they plainly diſcovered that they
had ſecretly plotted to joyn with <hi>Philips</hi> Party, as far as they had
an opportunity to do them any eminent ſervice: ſome think the Engliſh
failed in point of prudence not managing that buſineſs ſo warily as they
might, which if they had done, their defection had been prevented, but it is
moſt probable that <hi>Philip</hi> had hired them to own his quarrel, by
ſending them gifts in the Spring; and that the body of the ſaid
<hi>Indians</hi> were moſt readily inclined thereunto: But the Sachims and
the elder ones of them, ſeemed loth at firſt to engage againſt the
<hi>Engliſh.</hi> In concluſion, when they had ſo <pb n="37" facs="tcp:171788:28"/>
falſly left their Dwellings, and were running after <hi>Philip</hi> and the
<hi>Nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net Indians</hi> (at that time harboured in thoſe Woods) the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> were ſo provoked, that were under Capt. <hi>Lothrop</hi>
and Capt. <hi>Beers,</hi> that they purſued after them very early the next
morning, and overtook them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ten miles above <hi>Hatfield,</hi> at a place
called <hi>Sugar-loaf Hill,</hi> and had a ſmall skirmiſh with them,
wherein there were nine or ten of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſlain, and about
twenty ſix <hi>Indians:</hi> yet the reſt eſcaped; and ſo joyned with
<hi>Philip</hi> and his Company, preſently after which accident, they were
ſo emboldned, that upon the firſt of <hi>September,</hi> about ſeven
dayes after they ſet upon <hi>Dearfield,</hi> killed one Man, and laid moſt
of the Houſes in aſhes. About two or three dayes after they fell upon
<hi>Squakoag,</hi> an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther new Plantation, fifteen miles higher up the River,
above <hi>Dearfield,</hi> where they killed nine or ten of the People, the
reſt hardly eſcaped into the Gariſon houſe.</p>
            <p>The next day, this diſaſter not being known, Captain
<hi>Beers,</hi> for fear of the worſt, with thirty ſix men, was ſent up
to the ſaid <hi>Squakeag,</hi> with ſupplies both of men and proviſion to
ſecure the ſmall Gariſon there, but before they came very near to the
Town, they were ſet upon by many hundreds of the <hi>Indians</hi> out of the
Buſhes by a Swamp ſide, of whom Capt. <hi>Beers</hi> (who was known to
fight valiantly to the very laſt) with about twenty of his men, were by this
ſudden ſurprifal there ſlain, the reſt flying back to <hi>Hadly.</hi>
Here the Barbarous Villains ſhewed their inſolent rage and cruelty, more
then ever before, cutting off the heads of ſome of the ſlain, and fixing
them upon Poles near the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and not only ſo, but one (if not more) was
found with a Chain hooked into his under jaw, and ſo hung up on the Bow of a
Tree, (tis feared he was hung up alive) by which means they thought to daunt
and diſcourage any that might come to their relief, and alſo to terrifie
thoſe that ſhould be Spectators with the beholding ſo ſad an object:
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that Major <hi>Treat</hi> with his Company, going up two days
after, to fetch off the reſidue of the Gariſon, were ſolemnly affected
with that doleful ſight, which made them make the more haſt to bring down
the Gariſon, not waiting for any opportunity to take revenge upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
having but an hundred with him, two few for ſuch a purpoſe, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Appleton</hi> going up after him, met him coming down, and would willingly
have perſwaded them, to have turned back, to ſee if they could have made
any ſpoil upon the Enemy, but the greateſt part adviſed to the contrary,
ſo that they were all forced to return, with what they could carry away,
leaving the reſt for a booty to the Enemy, who ſhall ere long pay a ſad
reckoning for their Robberies and Cruelties, in the <pb n="38" facs="tcp:171788:29"/> time
appointed: but the ſufferings of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were not as yet come
to their height, for after they were come to <hi>Hadly,</hi> the Commander in
chief taking Counſel with the Officers of the Souldiers, ordered them that
were then preſent to Gariſon the Towns about; ſome to be at
<hi>North-Hampton, Hatfield, Dearfield,</hi> and ſome to remain at
<hi>Hadly</hi> where were the Head-quarters of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But
perceiving that little good was to be done upon the Enemy in thoſe parts, it
was agreed that what Corn was left at <hi>Dearfield,</hi> being threſhed out
as well as they could in thoſe tumults (about three thouſand Buſhels was
ſuppoſed to be there ſtanding in ſtacks) ſhould be brought to
<hi>Hadly,</hi> and wait further time to fight the Enemy. It came to C.
<hi>Lothrops</hi> turn, or rather it was his choice with about eighty men to
guard ſeveral Carts laden with Corn, &amp; other Goods, the Company under
Capt. <hi>Moſely</hi> then quartering at <hi>Dearfield</hi> intended that day
to purſue after the Enemy. But upon <hi>September</hi> 18. that moſt fatal
day, the ſaddeſt that ever befel <hi>New-England,</hi> as the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were
marching along with the Carts (it may be too ſecurely) never apprehending
danger ſo near, were ſuddenly ſet upon, and almoſt all cut off (not
above ſeven or eight eſcaping) which great defeat came to paſs by the
unadviſed proceeding of the Captain (who was himſelf ſlain in the firſt
aſſault) although he wanted neither courage nor skill, to lead his
Souldiers; but having taken up a wrong notion about the beſt way and manner
of fighting with the <hi>Indians</hi> (which he was always wont to argue for)
<hi>viz.</hi> that it were beſt to deal with the <hi>Indians</hi> in their
own way, <hi>ſc.</hi> by skulking behind Trees, and taking their aim at
ſingle perſons, which is the uſual manner of the <hi>Indians</hi>
fighting one with another, but herein was his great miſtake, in not
conſidering the great diſadvantage a ſmaller Company would have in
dealing that way with a greater multitude; for if five have to deal with one,
they may ſurround him, and every one take his aim at him, while he can level
but at one of his Enemies at a time: which groſs miſtake of his, was the
ruine of a choice company of young men, the very ſlower of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of
<hi>Eſſex,</hi> all culled out of the Towns belonging to that County, none
of which were aſhamed to ſpeak with the Enemy in the gate: their dear
Relations at home mourning for them, like <hi>Rachel</hi> for her children, and
would not be comforted, not only becauſe they were not, but becauſe they
were ſo miſerably loſt. (The like miſtake was conceived to be the
reaſon of the loſs of the former perſons, ſlain with the ſaid
<hi>Lothrop,</hi> purſuing the <hi>Indians</hi> that ran away from
<hi>Hadly,</hi> and of the twenty ſlain with Capt. <hi>Beers</hi> men, who
betook themſelves at firſt to their Trees and at the laſt a few got to
their Horſes ſoon after their Captain was <pb n="39" facs="tcp:171788:29"/> ſhot
down.) For had he ordered his men to March in a Body, as ſome of his
fellow-Commanders adviſed, either backward, or forward, in reaſon, they had
not loſt a quarter o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

little or no loſs in compariſon of the other. And having fought all thoſe
<hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> for five or ſix hours upon a ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch, loſt not above two men all that
while, nor received other damage beſides eight or nine that were woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
which yet were carried to their quarters at night at <hi>Hatfield,</hi>
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if theſe had proceeded in the ſame way of fighting as Capt.
<hi>Lothrop</hi> did in the morning, they might have been ſurrounded, and
ſo have been ſerved as the former were: but God had otherwiſe determined
in his ſecret counſel, and therefore that was hid from the one which was a
means to preſerve the other Company.</p>
            <p>Other releif alſo was ſeaſonably ſent in, <hi>viz.</hi> a
Company of Engliſh, and <hi>Mohegin</hi> or <hi>Pipuod</hi> Indians under the
Command of Major <hi>Treat,</hi> who was in the morning marching another way,
<hi>viz.</hi> up toward <hi>Squakheag</hi> to ſeek after the enemy that way,
with about an hundred ſouldiers, Indians and Engliſh, upon whoſe approach
the enemy, pretty well acquainted by this laſt encounter with the valour of
the Engliſh, immediately went clear away, giving Major <hi>Treat</hi> and
Capt. <hi>Moſely,</hi> who returned to <hi>Dearfield</hi> that night, an
opportunity to bury the ſlain the next day. As Capt. <hi>Moſely</hi> came
upon the Indians in the morning he found them ſtripping of the ſlain,
amongſt whom was one <hi>Robert Dutch</hi> of <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> having been
ſorely wounded by a bullet that raſed to his ſkull, and then mauled by
the Indian hatchets, left for dead by the Salvages, and ſtript by them of all
but his skin, yet when <hi>Capt, Moſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came</hi> near, he almoſt
miraculouſly as one raiſed from the dead came towards the Engliſh, to
their no ſmall amazement, by whom being received and cloathed, he was carryed
off to the next gariſon, and is <pb n="40" facs="tcp:171788:30"/> living &amp; in perfect
health at this day May he be to the friend &amp; relations of the reſt of the
ſlain, an emblem of their more perfect reſurrection at the laſt day to
receive their crowns among the reſt of the Martyres that have laid down or
ventured their lives as a teſtimony to the truth of their Religion, as well
as love to their Country.</p>
            <p>This ſore defeat of Capt. <hi>Lothrop</hi> and his men, was the
more to be lamented in that (falling out ſo ſoon after two other of the
like nature) it ſo emboldned the enemy, that they durſt ſoon after
adventure upon conſide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>able
towns, though well gariſoned with ſouldiers, and gave them occaſion of
moſt inſolent Braving the Gariſon at <hi>Dearfield</hi> the next day,
hanging up the garments of the Engliſh, in fight of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, yet on
the other ſide of the river. However it pleaſed God, who is alwayes wont to
remember his people in their low eſtate, to put ſuch a reſtraint upon
them, that when they paſſed very near the Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon houſe at
<hi>Dearfield</hi> (wherein were not left above twenty ſeven ſouldiers)
their Captain uſing this ſtratagem, to cauſe his trumpet to ſound as if
he had another troop near by to be called together, they turned another way and
made no attempt upon the houſe where that ſmall number was, which if they
had done with any ordinary reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo ſmall an handfull of men could
hardly have withſtood the force of ſo many hundreds as were then gathered
together.</p>
            <p>What loſs the Enemy ſuſtained by the reſiſtance of Capt.
<hi>Lothrop</hi> &amp; his men, (who no doubt being all reſolute young men,
and ſeeing they ſhould be forced by the hard law of the ſword to foregoe
their lives, held them at as high a rate as they could) is not certainly known.
It hath ſince been confeſſed by ſome of the Indians themſelves, that
they loſt ninety ſix of their m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n that day. Capt. <hi>Moſelyes</hi> men coming ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly upon
them when they were pillaging of the dead, fell upon them with ſuch a ſmart
aſſault, that they drove them preſently into a ſwamp following them
ſo cloſe, that for ſeven miles together they fought them upon a march,
charging them through and through. <hi>Perez Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage</hi> and Leiut,
<hi>Pickering</hi> his Leiutenants deſerving no little part of the honour of
that dayes Service, being ſometimes called to lead the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in the front,
while Capt <hi>Moſely</hi> took a little breath, who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt melted
with labouring, commanding, and leading his men through the mideſt of the
enemy.</p>
            <p>The Indians gathered together i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thoſe parts, appearing ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and, as might juſtly he
ſuppoſed, growing more confident by ſome of their laſt ſucceſſes,
and the number of our men being after this ſad rate diminiſhed, Recruits
alſo not being ſuddenly to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, <pb n="41" facs="tcp:171788:30"/> at ſo great
a diſtance as an hundred miles from all ſupplyes, the Commander in chief
with the Officers, ſaw a neceſſity of ſlighting that Gariſon at
<hi>Dearfield,</hi> imploying the Forces they had to ſecure and ſtrengthen
the three next towns below upon <hi>Connecticut River.</hi> And it was well
that counſel was thought upon; for now thoſe wretched Caitiffs begin to
talk of great matters, hoping that by degrees they might deſtroy all the
towns thereabout, as they had already begun: Their hopes no doubt, were not a
little heightned by the acceſſion of <hi>Springfield Indians</hi> to their
party, who had in appearance all this time ſtood the firmeſt to the
intereſt of the Engliſh of all the reſt in thoſe parts: But they all
hanging together, like Serpents eggs, were eaſily perſwaded to joyn with
thoſe of <hi>Hadly</hi> (there being ſo near allyance between them, for the
Sachem of <hi>Springfield</hi> Indians was the father of <hi>Hadly</hi> Sachem)
not only by the ſucceſs of their treacherous and bloud-thirſty
companions, but by the ſame inbred malice and antipathy againſt the
Engliſh manners and Religion.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Springfield</hi> were not unſenſible of
their danger, and therefore had upon the firſt breaking forth of theſe
troubles been treating with their Indians, and had received from them the
firmeſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance, and pledges of their faithfulneſs, and friendſhip
that could be immagined or deſired, both by Covenant, promiſes and
Hoſtages given for ſecurity, ſo as no doubt was left in any of their
minds: Yet did theſe faithleſs and ungratefull Monſters plot with
<hi>Philips</hi> Indians to burn and deſtroy all <hi>Springfield,</hi> as
they had done <hi>Brookfield</hi> before: to that end they ſent cunningly and
enticed away the Hoſtages from <hi>Hartford,</hi> where they were, perhaps
too ſecurely watched over, a day or two before: Then receiving above three
hunderd of <hi>Philips</hi> Indians into their Fort, privately in the night
time, ſo as they were neither diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned nor ſuſpected: Yea ſo
confident were ſuch of the inhabitants as were moſt converſant with the
Indians at their Fort, that they would not believe there was any ſuch plot in
hand, when it was ſtrangly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by one <hi>Toto</hi> an Indian at
<hi>Windſor,</hi> better affected to the Engliſh, (about eighteen or twenty
miles below <hi>Springfield,</hi> upon the ſame Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver) and ſo by Poſt
tidings thereof brought to <hi>Springfield</hi> the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; inſomuch
that the Lieutenant of the town, <hi>Cooper</hi> by name, was ſo far from
believing the Stratagem, that in the morning himſelf with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other would
venture to ride up to the Fort, to ſee whether things were ſo or no. The
Fort was about a mile from the town; when he came within a little thereof, he
met theſe bloudy and deceitfull Monſters, newly iſſued out of their
<hi>Equus Trojanus</hi> to act their intended miſchief, <pb n="42" facs="tcp:171788:31"/>
they preſently fired upon him diverſe of them, and ſhot him in ſeveral
places through the body, yet being a man of ſtout courage, he kept his
horſe, till he recovered the next gariſon houſe, his companion they
ſhot dead upon the place, by this meanes giving a ſad alarm to the town of
their intended miſchief, which was inſtantly fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed in all places where there were no
Gariſons. The poor people having never an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer to lead them, being like
ſheep ready for the ſlaughter, and no doubt the whole town had been totally
deſtroyed, but that a report of the Plot being caryed about over night, Major
<hi>Treat</hi> came from <hi>Weſt field</hi> time enough in a manner for
their reſcue, but wanting boates to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his men, could not doe ſo
much good as he deſired. Major <hi>Pyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon</hi> coming from <hi>Hadly</hi>
with Capt. <hi>Appleton</hi> and what Forces they could bring along with them,
thirty two houſes being firſt conſumed, preſerved the reſt of the
town from being turned to aſhes, in which the over credulous Inhabitants
might now ſee (what b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fore they
would not believe at the burning Major <hi>Pynchons</hi> Barns and Stables a
few dayes before, to a very great damage of the Owner) the faithleſs and
deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full friendſhip amongſt thoſe perfidious, cruel and helliſh
Monſters.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the ruines of the ſaid dwellings, the ſaddeſt to
behold was the houſe of Mr. <hi>Pelatiah Glover,</hi> Miniſter of the Town,
furniſhed with a brave Library, which he had but newly brought back from a
Gariſon wherein it had been for ſome time before ſecured, but as if the
danger had been over with them, the ſaid Miniſter a great Student, and an
<hi>helluo librorum,</hi> being impatient for want of his Books, brought them
back to his great ſorrow, fit for a Bonfire for the proud inſulting enemy.
Of all the miſchiefs done by the ſaid enemy before that day, the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
this town of <hi>Springfield</hi> did more then any other, diſcover the
ſaid Actors to be the children of the Devill, full of all ſubtlety and
malice, there having been for about forty years ſo good correſpondence
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Engliſh of that town and the neighbouring Indians; But in them
is made good what is ſaid in the Pſalm, that though their words were
ſmoother then oyle, yet were they drawn ſwords.</p>
            <p>After ſome little time ſpent in gariſoning the place, and
helping the Inhabitants to ſecure what they had left, the Engliſh
ſouldiers moſt of them returned back to <hi>Hadly</hi> their head-quarters,
and Major <hi>Pynchon</hi> being ſo full of incumbrances, by reaſon of the
late ſpoyls done to himſelf, and his neighbours at <hi>Springfield,</hi>
could not any longer attend the Service of commanding in Chief as he had done
before, wherefore being according to his earneſt Requeſt to the Council
eaſed of that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, Capt. <hi>Samuel Appleton</hi> was ordered to
ſucceed in taking the charge <pb n="43" facs="tcp:171788:31"/> of the Souldiers left in
thoſe upper towns, by whoſe induſtry, skill and courage, thoſe towns
were preſerved from runing the ſame fate with the reſt, wholy or in part
ſo lately turned into aſhes. For the enemy grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very confident by the
late ſucceſſes, came with all their fury the nineteenth of
<hi>October</hi> following upon <hi>Hatfield,</hi> hoping no leſs then to doe
the like miſchief to them, they had newly done to <hi>Springfield:</hi> But
according to the good providence of Almighty God, Major <hi>Treat</hi> was
newly returned to <hi>Northampton,</hi> Capt. <hi>Moſely</hi> and Capt.
<hi>Poole</hi> were then gariſoning the ſaid <hi>Hatfield,</hi> and Capt.
<hi>Appleton</hi> for the like end quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering at <hi>Hadly,</hi> when on the
ſudden ſeven or eight hundred of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my came upon the town in all
quarters, having firſt killed or taken two or three of the Scouts belonging
to the town, and ſeven more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Capt. <hi>Moſely</hi> his
Company: But they were ſo well enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained on all hands where they attempted
to break in upon the town, that they found it too hot for them. Major
<hi>Appleton</hi> with great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage defending one end of the town, and Capt.
<hi>Moſely</hi> as ſtoutly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the middle, and Capt.
<hi>Poole</hi> the other end; that they were by the reſolution of the
Engliſh inſtantly beaten off, without doing much harm. Capt.
<hi>Appletons</hi> Sergeant was mortally wounded juſt by his ſide another
bullet paſſing through his own hair, by that whiſper telling him that
death was very near, but did him no other harm. Night com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, it could not
be diſcerned what loſs the enemy ſuſtained, diverſe were ſeen to
fall, ſome run through a ſmall river, others caſt their guns into the
water (it being their manner to venture as much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the dead bodyes of
their friends, as to defend them when alive)</p>
            <p>At laſt after the burning of ſome few barns, with ſome other
buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, the enemy haſted away as faſt as they came on, leaving the
En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh to bleſs God who had ſo mercifully delivered them from the fury
of their mercileſs foes, who had in conceit without doubt, devoured them all:
But this reſolute and valiant repulſe, put ſuch a check upon the pride of
the enemy, that they made no further attempt upon any of thoſe towns for the
preſent, but winter drawing on, they retired all of them to their general
rendezvouze at <hi>Narhaganſet,</hi> where we ſhall leave them for the
preſent plotting their general deſign of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing their intended
miſchief againſt the Engliſh the next Spring.</p>
            <p>Our Weſtern Plantations upon <hi>Connecticut River,</hi> were
the ſtage whereon were acted the moſt remarkable paſſages of this
barbarous War hitherto, which was ſoon after removed into many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places
of the Country in the Winter and Spring following, whither our diſcourſe
muſt in the next place purſue it: There was not any <pb n="44" facs="tcp:171788:32"/>
great matter acted by the Enemy amongſt the Plantations upon the great River
during the Winter, after the aſſault made upon <hi>Hatfield October</hi>
19. It is evident that the body of them returned to <hi>Narrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſet</hi>
upon the approach of the Winter, which ſet in more early then it uſed in
other years: where <hi>Philip</hi> did beſtow himſelf in the winter
ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is not ſo certain, ſome ſay that he repaired further
wellward, to try his fortune with thoſe Indians that

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly towards <hi>Albany,</hi> near
the <hi>Dutch River:</hi> others more probably conceive that he lay hid in
ſome part of the <hi>Narrhaganſet Country;</hi> for though he was not
certainly known to be about the Fort at <hi>Narrhaganſet,</hi> when it was
taken by our Forces in the winter, yet as ſoon as ever they were driven out
of the Country in <hi>February,</hi> he was found amongſt them that did the
miſchief at <hi>Lancaſter</hi> in that month.</p>
            <p>Some ſtragling parties of them remained about <hi>North-Hampton,
Weſt field &amp; Springfield</hi> ſome time after their defeat at
<hi>Hatfield:</hi> ſeven or eight of the Inhabitants of
<hi>North-Hampton</hi> in the end of <hi>October,</hi> venturing to fetch in
ſome of their Harveſt, that was left ſomewhere out of the Town, were in
danger of being ſurpriſed, having laid their Arms under their Cart, ſo as
being deſtitute of means to make their defence, they were glad to fly away
with the Horſes out of their Cart, leaving what they were about to the
pleaſure of the Indians that aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Major <hi>Treat</hi> upon the
hearing the Alarm, preſently repaired thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but could not come time
enough to deſtroy any of the Enemy, nor yet to prevent their burning of four
or five Houſes, with two or three Barns that ſtood ſomewhat out of the
Town. Within a little time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they kill'd three of the ſame Town, as they
were at work in a Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow not far from the Town: they intended alſo to have
burned the Mill, but it was too well guarded by two files of Musketiers lodged
there for the purpoſe, who put them beſide their intent, Six or ſeven of
<hi>Springfield</hi> ſoon after going to the Mill at <hi>Weſtfield</hi>
(that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to their own Town being burned <hi>October</hi>
5<hi>th.</hi>) and venturing without Arms, three of them were killed by ſome
of the Enemy, who took the advantage alſo to burn four or five Houſes that
belonged to the ſaid <hi>Weſt field:</hi> but by the end of
<hi>November</hi> the coaſt was pritty clear of them, unleſs ſome few of
them that lay lurking in the Swamps therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts all the winter, doing ſome
ſmall miſchief upon ſome out-dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of <hi>Springfield.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The expedition into the <hi>Narrhaganſet Country</hi> follows in
order in the next place to be related; but before we come thither, a little
notice muſt be taken by the way, of an unſucceſsful attempt upon the
Indians <pb n="45" facs="tcp:171788:32"/> about <hi>Haſſanemeſit &amp;
Poppachuog,</hi> whither Capt. <hi>Henchman</hi> was ſent in the beginning of
<hi>November;</hi> where alſo Captain <hi>Sill</hi> was ordered to meet him
with another Company from <hi>Cambridge,</hi> with intent to have bear up the
Indians quarters in thoſe parts: they being known to have had an hand in the
outrages committed upon thoſe that belonged to <hi>Malberough</hi> and
<hi>Menaham;</hi> cutting off the ſcalp of a millers Boy, who is yet
alive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>November</hi> 1. 1675. Capt. <hi>Henchman</hi> marched out of
<hi>Boſton</hi> intending to viſit the Indians about
<hi>Haſſenemeſit:</hi> the third day they ſaw ſome fires of the
Indians, yet could not meet with them that made them: the 4<hi>th</hi> day they
marched to ſome part of the Indian Plantations called
<hi>Haſſene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſit:</hi> the Captain would have taken up his quarters a
mile on this ſide, but ſome of his Officers over-ruled him, to whoſe
importunity he gave way, and marched a mile further towards the Enemy, and by
that means ſaved the Millers youth, taken the week before from
<hi>Malberough;</hi> for in the morning very early, as the Scouts were looking
out, they ſpyed a Wigwam, where ſome Indians that had carried away the
youth, had lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all night in ſome Wigwam near by, when the Indians ſaw
our Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, they haſted away, and left the <hi>Malberough</hi> youth
behind them, who by that means eſcaped their hands. Our men under Capt.
<hi>Henchman</hi> marched on to <hi>Poppachuog,</hi> and finding the Indians
all fled, (although they perceived by a Meſſenger accidentally ſent back,
that the Indians followed them all that way they marched) they came back to
<hi>Mendham</hi> to ſettle things in that Town: ſome of the Inhabitants
informed them of ſome Indian Wigwams about ten miles off: the Captain with
<hi>Philip Curtice</hi> his Lieutenant, reſolved to give them a camiſado in
their Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wams that night; to that end, they mounted two and twenty upon
Horſes, riding up ten miles into the Woods, and when they came near the
Wigwams, they diſmounted, and intended preſently to march up, and give an
aſſault upon them, after they had firſt made a ſhout to fright the
Enemy: they ordered one half to follow the Lieutenant, the other to follow the
Captain, when they came within a quarter of a mile of the place, their Dogs
began to bark, at which they ſtopd, and by and by marching again, intended
preſently to fire in upon them, but the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains foot ſlipping, he could
hardly recover himſelf, when ſuddenly looking behind him, he ſaw no man
following of him: the Lieutenant had five behind him, who with thoſe five
reſolutely fired on that ſide he was appointed to make the aſſault
upon; but they were repulſed by the <hi>Indians,</hi> who firing out of their
dens, ſhot down the Lieutenant and another, the reſt preſently ran away
to a fence: the Captain with all <pb n="46" facs="tcp:171788:33"/> vehemency urged them to
ſtay, they replied, they went back but only to charge, yet went clear away,
by which means, together with the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardize of the former, ſo ſad a loſs
befell the Company, which could not eaſily be rep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed: however the Enemy preſently
deſerted the Wigwam and gave our men the next day an opportunity to fetch off
their two dead men, and bury them, and ſo with grief and ſhame were
conſtrained to return to their quarters at <hi>Mendham,</hi> to whoſe
Inhabitants they gave notice of 200 buſhels of Corn belonging to the Indians,
that might have been preſerved, which for want of hands was loſt by the
fire, that the Enemy might not be benefited thereby. It appears by the
fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going paſſage, that the time of our deliverance was not yet come, and
that God had further tryals to acquaint us with before he would turn his hand
upon our Enemies. But it pleaſed the Lord in mercy ſo to order things, that
they themſelves fell into that pit they were digging for others, as ſhall
appear more fully in what follows.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh Plantations about <hi>Hadly</hi> being for the
preſent ſet a little at liberty by the Indians drawing off, like Seamen
after a Storm, counted it their beſt courſe to repair their tackling
againſt another that may be next coming, wherefore the Inhabitants concluded
it the ſafer way to make a kind of Barricado about their Towns, by ſetting
up Pallizadoes or cleft wood about eight foot long, as it were to break the
force of any ſudden aſſault which the <hi>Indians</hi> might make upon
them; which counſel proved very ſucceſsful; for although it be an
inconſiderable defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Warlike Enemy, that hath ſtrength
enough, and confidence to beſiege a place, yet it is ſufficient to prevent
any ſudden aſſault of ſuch a timerous and barbarous Enemy as theſe
were, for although they did afterwards in the Spring break through thoſe
Pallizadoes at <hi>North-Hampton,</hi> yet as ſoon as ever they began to be
repulſed, they ſaw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves like Wolves in a Pound, that they could
not fly away at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſo as they never adventured to break
through afterward upon any of the Towns ſo ſecured.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe of <hi>Springfield,</hi> they were now and then
Alarmed with a few skulking Indians lurking about in the adjacent Woods; as
once at the Long Meadow, where half a ſcore of them were ſeen about an
houſe remote from the Town, who were purſued by a party of the Engliſh
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Windſor,</hi> and ſo eſcaped, after the Engliſh had made
one ſhot upon them, not knowing certainly how many they killed. So at another
time, a few of thoſe barbarous wretches kill'd a poor man belonging to
<hi>Springfield,</hi> as he was going to his houſe to look after his Corn on
the other ſide of the River, and after they had killed the man, they burnt 
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:171788:33"/> down his houſe; yet attempted no further miſchief upon
that part of the Town that had eſcaped the fury of the Flames,
<hi>October</hi> 5. By which it is evident, that all the number of Indians that
had aſſaulted them befo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, had
not drawn themſelves for the preſent to their winter quarters, ſome to
the <hi>Dutch River,</hi> but the greateſt number of them to be ſure were
found in the winter at the <hi>Narrhaganſet Fort,</hi> where we ſhall leave
them for the preſent till the Forces of the United Colonies ſhall fire them
out of their neſts.</p>
            <p>The Souldiers continuing ſome time at <hi>Hatfield</hi> after
this victory, as we may well call it (for it ſeems to have given the firſt
check to the rage of the heathen within the Jurisdiction of the united
Colonyes, they have been obſerved ever ſince to have been on the loſing

advantage as to their numbers, or covert of the woods and buſhes: although

upon them) our forces therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all called home, ſave ſome left for
gariſoning the towns there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioners of the united Colonyes taking into ſerious
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration the preſent ſtate of things, <hi>viz.</hi> that there were
before this time ſo many hundreds gathered together into one Body, and that
there was great reaſon to fear, if they were let alone till the next ſpring
they might all riſe together as one man round about us, and that one Town
after another might eaſily be deſtroyed, before any help could be
diſpatched to them. On the one hand the ſharpneſs of the winter in
theſe parts was well weighed, ſo extream that it might hazard the loſs of
a thouſand men in one night, if they were forced to lodge abroad in the open
field, as alſo the difficulty, if not impoſſibility of ſending any
relief to them at any diſtance, the depth of ſnow uſually making the
wayes unpaſſable for diverſe months together.</p>
            <p>On the other hand it was conſidered, that if the enemy were let
alone till the next ſummer, it would be impoſſible to deal with them, or
find them any where, but they might waſte one company of Souldiers after
another, as was ſeen by the experience of the former year. Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
alſo that the <hi>Narhaganſets,</hi> the moſt numerous of all the reſt,
and the beſt provided of proviſion of all the other Indians, had now
declared themſelves our enemyes, who if they were let alone till the winter
was over, we ſhould be unable to deal with ſo many enemyes at once, that
could on a ſudden on any occaſion ſpread themſelves like graſhoppers
all over the Country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:171788:34"/>It was therefore finally agreed upon by the
general conſent of all, to to fall upon the winter quarters of our enemyes,
by a more conſiderable Army (if I may ſo call it) gathered out of all the
three Colonyes, and that with all expedition, at fartheſt not to exceed the
tenth of <hi>December</hi> before they ſhould have a thouſand men in arms
ready for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne.</p>
            <p>As for the late League made or rather renewed with the
<hi>Narhagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets,</hi> it was ſufficiently evident &amp; known, that they
had all along from the firſt day when it was confirmed broken every article
of it, ſpecially in not delivering up the enemyes which had ſheltered
themſelves with them all this while, which though they did not poſitively
deny, yet did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but find excuſes, to defer it one week after another,
till at the laſt they would be excuſed till the next Spring, upon pretence
that they could not before that time get them together. Beſide the favouring
of thoſe that fled to them, and ſupplying the whole Body of the enemy with
victuals, upon all occaſions. It was likewiſe ſtrongly ſuſpected that
in all the late proceedings of the enemy, many of their young men were known to
be actually in arms againſt us, many of whom were found ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her wounded amongſt them in their
wigwams, or elſe were occaſionally ſeen returning back, after exploits
abroad, to be healed of their wounds at home. Alſo ſome of our mens guns
that were loſt at <hi>Dearfield</hi> were found in the Fort when it was
fired. Therefore all ſcruples as to the juſtneſs and neceſſity of the
war being removed, the only queſtion was, whether it were feaſible and
expedient in the winter. The exigent was very great, and the choyce very hard:
But as David when he was ſtreightened with many difficultyes at once, choſe
rather to fall into the hands of God whoſe mercyes were great, though he
might be provoked to cauſe his jealouſie to ſmoak againſt thoſe of
his own heritage for a time: ſo in this exigent it was generally conceived to
be moſt expedient for the Country, to caſt themſelves upon the
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of a mercifull and gracious God, rather then by delayes to
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to the treachery and cruelty of a perfidious enemy.</p>
            <p>A War therefore ſpeedily to be carryed on in the very depth of
win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, being agreed upon, care was taken for ſupplyes, as the difficulty of
ſuch an affair ſo circumſtanced did require, though poſſibly not with
ſo much neceſſary care, and ſo ſuitable proviſion, as had been
deſired, if what came afterward to paſs could have been foreſeen (which
perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture might be the reaſon things went on ſo heavily for want of
well oyling the wheels) in the mean time a ſmall Army of a thouſand
fighting men, well appointed, were ordered by the Commiſſioners to 
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:171788:34"/> be gathered by proportion out of all the Colonyes; of
which number the ſhare of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> was to be five
hundred and twenty ſeven, the reſt were to be ſupplyed out of
<hi>Plimouth</hi> and <hi>Connecticut</hi> Colonyes, All other ſupplyes were
taken care for, as well as the ſuddenneſs of the Expedition, and difficulty
of the ſeaſon would allow. The ſaid thouſand men, beſide ſome
Voluntiers of Indian Friends, were by the time and place appointed as near as
could be had, called together, and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion granted to the honourable
<hi>Joſiah Winſlow</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> the preſent Governour of
<hi>Plimouth Colony,</hi> a man of known ability and integrity, every way ſo
well qualified with courage and Reſolution, as well as pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and
diſcretion, as might have preferred him to the conduct of a far greater Army
then ever is like to be gathered together in this part of the world, in this or
in following Generations. And indeed as he was the firſt Governour over any
of the united Colonyes in <hi>New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> of them that were born in the
place, ſo may he well paſs for a pattern of any of the ſucceeding race,
that may come after.</p>
            <p>Under him as Commander in Chief were ordered ſix Companyes from
the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> under the Command of Major <hi>Appleton,</hi>
Capt. <hi>Moſely,</hi> Capt. <hi>Gardener,</hi> Capt. <hi>Davenport,</hi>
Capt. <hi>Oliver,</hi> Capt. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> Five Companyes from
<hi>Connecticut</hi> under Major <hi>Treat,</hi> Capt. <hi>Siely,</hi> Capt.
<hi>Gallop,</hi> Capt. <hi>Maſon,</hi> Capt. <hi>Wats,</hi> and Capt.
<hi>Marſhal,</hi> Two Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes from <hi>Plimouth,</hi> under Major
<hi>Bradford</hi> and Capt. <hi>Goram.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Under the Governour of <hi>Plimouth</hi> as Commander in Chief in
this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, were ſent as Majors of the Forces belonging to each Colony,
Major <hi>Robert Treat</hi> for the Forces belonging to <hi>Connecticut,</hi>
and Major <hi>Bradford</hi> for thoſe of the Colony of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and
Major <hi>Samuel Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton</hi> for thoſe of the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi>
to whom by the honourable Major General of the ſaid Colony were ſix
Companyes of Foot delivered at <hi>Dedham, December</hi> the 9<hi>th.</hi>
1675, containing in number 465 fighting men, beſides a Troop of Horſe under
the Command of Capt. <hi>Thomas Prentice</hi> attending upon them. That night
they marched to <hi>Woodcocks</hi> about 27. miles from <hi>Dedham.</hi> The
next night they arrived at <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conck;</hi> Capt. <hi>Moſely</hi> and his
Company went from thence with Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> by water, the reſt ferried
over the water to <hi>Providence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day, <hi>Decemb.</hi> the 12<hi>th.</hi> they paſſed
over <hi>Patuxet River,</hi> and then marching through <hi>Pomhams
Country,</hi> at night they met with Capt. <hi>Moſely</hi> and his Company at
Mr. <hi>Smiths</hi> in <hi>Wickford,</hi> the place intended for their
Head-quarters. Capt. <hi>Moſely</hi> in his way thither had happily
ſurpriſed thirty ſix Indians, one of whom he took along with him as a
Guide, <hi>Peter</hi> by name, that was at that time under ſome diſguſt
with his <pb n="50" facs="tcp:171788:35"/> Country-men, or his Sachem, which made him prove
the more real friend to our forces in that ſervice, wherein he faithfully
performed what he promiſed, and without his aſſiſtance our men would
have been much at a loſs to have found the enemy, until it had been too late
to have fought them.</p>
            <p>Two dayes after, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 14. Five Files of men ſent out
under Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant <hi>Bennet</hi> and another, upon the Scout, kill'd one man and
one wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and brought in four more by one of the clock: the whole Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
marched after into ſome of the Sachems Country, where they burnt an hundred
and fifty Wigwams, killed ſeven of the enemy, and brought in eight
Priſoners when they returned at night.</p>
            <p>The next day an Indian called <hi>Stone-wall-John</hi> pretended
to come from the Sachems, intimating their willingneſs to have peace with the
En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, yet could the Meſſenger hardly forbear threatning, vapouring of
their numbers and ſtrength, adding withall that the Engliſh durſt not
fight them: whatever were pretended by this treacherous fellow, ſome of his
Crew as he went home met with ſome of Capt. <hi>Gardners</hi> men, that were
ſtragling about their own buſineſs contrary to order, and ſlew his
Serjeant, with one or two more. Two alſo of Capt. <hi>Olivers</hi> men were
killed in like manner; a ſolemn warning for Souldiers not to be too
ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous in an enemyes Country. For preventing the like miſchief upon other
Companyes, more care was taken as they paſſed to the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarters, ſome
of the Companyes being lodged three miles there from. Capt.
<hi>Moſelyes,</hi> Capt. <hi>Davenports</hi> and Capt. <hi>Olivers</hi>
Company being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſent about that time to bring Major <hi>Appletons</hi>
Company to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Quarters, a few deſperate Indians creeping under a
ſtone wall near the place, fired twenty or thirty gunns at <hi>Moſely</hi>
in particular, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander well known amongſt them, but the reſt of the
Company running down upon them, killed one of them, and ſcattered the
reſt.</p>
            <p>The next day Capt. <hi>Prentice</hi> with his Troop, being ſent
to <hi>Petequam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcot,</hi> returned with the ſad news of burning <hi>Jerry
Bulls</hi> Gariſon houſe, and killing ten Engliſh men and five women and
children, but two eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in all. This is the chance of warr which they who
under take, muſt prepare to undergoe.</p>
            <p>The next day brought from the ſame place a little better news,
though not enough to ballance the ſorrow of the former, <hi>viz.</hi> that
<hi>Connecticut</hi> Forces were come thither with three hundred Engliſh, and
an hundred and fifty <hi>Mohegins,</hi> ready fixed to warr on the behalf of
the Engliſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Narhaganſets</hi> their mortal enemyes; and
by the way meeting a Party of the enemy, they ſlew five or ſix of them and
took as many <pb n="51" facs="tcp:171788:35"/> Priſoners. The whole number of all our
Forces being now come, the want of proviſion with the ſharpneſs of the
cold, minded them of expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherefore the very next day, the whole Body
of the <hi>Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet</hi> and <hi>Plimouth</hi> Forces marched away to
<hi>Pettyquamſcot</hi> intending to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the enemy upon the firſt
opportunity that next offered it ſelf: To the which reſolution thoſe of
<hi>Connecticut</hi> preſently conſented, as ſoon as they met together,
which was about five a clock in the afternoon: <hi>Bulls</hi> houſe intended
for their general Rendezvouze, being unhappily burnt down two or three days
before, there was no ſhelter left either for Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer or private Souldier,
ſo as they were neceſſitated to march on toward the enemy through the
ſnow, in a cold ſtormy evening, finding no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther defence all that night,
ſave the open air, nor other covering then a cold and moiſt fleece of
ſnow. Through all theſe difficultyes they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched from the break of the
next day, <hi>December</hi> 19. till one of the clock in the afternoon, without
either fire to warm them, or reſpite to take any food, ſave what they could
chew in their march. Thus having wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded fourteen or fifteen mile through the
Country of the old Queen, or <hi>Sunke Squaw</hi> of <hi>Narhaganſet:</hi>
they came at one a clock upon the edge of the Swamp where their guide
aſſured them they ſhould find Indians enough before night.</p>
            <p>Our Forces chopping thus upon the ſeat of the enemy, upon the
ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, they had no time either to draw up in any order or form of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
nor yet opportunity to conſult where or how to aſſault. As they marched
Capt. <hi>Moſely</hi> and Capt. <hi>Davenport</hi> led the Van, Major
<hi>Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and Capt. <hi>Oliver</hi> brought up the Reer of the
<hi>Maſſachuſet</hi> Forces; General <hi>Winſlow</hi> with the
<hi>Plimouth</hi> Forces marched in the Centre; thoſe of <hi>Connecticut</hi>
came up in the Reer of the whole Body: But the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers diſcerning Indians
in the edge of the Swamp, fired immediately upon them, who anſwering our men
in the ſame Language, retired preſently into the Swampe, our men followed
them in amayne, without ſtaying for the word of Command, as if every one were
ambitious who ſhould goe firſt, never making any ſtand till they came to
the ſides of the Fort, into which the Indians that firſt fired upon them
betook themſelves.</p>
            <p>It ſeems that there was but one entrance into the Fort, though
the enemy found many wayes to come out, but neither the Engliſh nor their
Guide well knew on which ſide the entrance lay; nor was it eaſie to have
made another; wherefore the good providence of Almighty God is the more to be
acknowledged, who as he led <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſometime by the Pillar of fire,
and the Cloud of his preſence a right way through the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo did
he now direct our Forces upon that ſide of the Fort, where 
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:171788:36"/> they might only enter though not without utmoſt danger,
and hazard. The Fort was raiſed upon a kind of Iſland of five or ſix
acres of riſing land in the midſt of a Swamp; the ſides of it were made
of palizadoes ſet upright the which was compaſſed about with an hedge of
almoſt a rod thickneſs, through which there was no paſſing, unleſs
they could have fired a way through, which then they had no time to doe. The
place where the Indians uſed ordinarily to enter themſelves, was over a
long tree over a place of water, where but one man could enter at a time, &amp;
which was ſo way-laid that they would have been cut off that had ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
there: But at one corner there was a Gap made up only with a long tree, about
four or five foot from the ground, over wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch men might eaſily paſs: But they had placed a kind
of a Block-houſe right over againſt the ſaid tree, from whence they
ſorely galled our men that firſt entred, ſome being ſhot dead upon the
tree, as Capt. <hi>Johnſon,</hi> and ſome as ſoon as they entred, as was
Capt. <hi>Davenport,</hi> ſo as they that firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred were forced
preſently to retire, and fall upon their bellyes till the fury of the enemyes
ſhot was pretty well ſpent, which, ſome Companyes that did not diſcern
the danger, nor obſerving, loſt ſundry of their men, but at the laſt
two Companyes being brought up beſides the four that firſt marched up, they
animated one another to make another aſſault, one of the Commanders crying
out. <hi>They run, they run,</hi> which did ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Souldiers that
they preſently entred amain. After a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number were well entred,
they preſently beat the enemy out of a Flanker on the left hand, which did a
little ſhelter our men from the enemyes ſhot, till more Company came up,
and ſo by degrees made up higher, firſt into the middle, and then into the
upper end of the Fort, till at the laſt they made the enemy all retire from
their Sconces, and fortified places, leaving multitudes of their dead Bodyes
upon the place, <hi>Connecticut</hi> Souldiers marching up in the Reer, being
not aware of the dangerous paſſage over the tree, in Command of the enemyes
Block-houſe, were at their firſt entrance many of them ſhot down,
although they came on with as gallant reſolution as any of the reſt under
the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their wiſe and valiant Leader, Major <hi>Treat</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The brunt of the Battle, or danger that day lay moſt upon the
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, whoſe part it was to lead on their ſeveral Companies in the
very face of Death, or elſe all had been loſt; ſo as all of them with
great valour and reſolution of minde, as not at all afraid to dy in ſo good
a cauſe, bravely led on their men in that deſperate aſſault; leaving
their lives in the place as the beſt teſtimony of their valour, and of love
to the cauſe of God and their Country: No leſs then ſix brave Captains
fell <pb n="53" facs="tcp:171788:36"/> that day in the aſſault, <hi>viz.</hi> Capt.
<hi>Davenport,</hi> Capt. <hi>Gardner,</hi> Capt. <hi>John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> of the
<hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> beſides Lieutenant <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pham,</hi> who died
ſome months after of his wounds received at that time. Capt. <hi>Gallop</hi>
alſo, and Capt. <hi>Siely,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Marſhal</hi> were ſlain of
thoſe that belonged to <hi>Connecticut</hi> Colony. It is uſually ſeen
that the valour of the Souldiers is much wrapped up in the lives of their
Commanders, yet was it found here, that the Souldiers were rather enraged then
diſcouraged by the loſs of their Commanders, which made them redouble their
Courage, and not give back after they were entred the ſecond time, till they
had driven out their Enemies: So as after much blood and many wounds dealt on
both ſides; the Engliſh ſeeing their advantage, began to fire the
Wigwams, where was ſuppoſed to be many of the Enemies Women and Children
deſtroyed, by the firing of at leaſt five or ſix hundred of thoſe
ſmoaky Cells.</p>
            <p>It is reported by them that firſt entred the <hi>Indians
Fort,</hi> that our Souldiers came upon them when they were ready to dreſs
their Dinner, but our ſudden; and unexpected aſſault put them beſides
that work, making their Cookrooms too hot for them at that time, when they and
their Mitchin fryed together: and probably ſome of them eat their Suppers in
a colder place that night: moſt of their Proviſion as well as their Hutts
being then conſumed with fire, and thoſe that were left alive forced to
hide themſelves in a Cedar Swamp, not far off, where they had nothing to
defend them from the cold but Boughs of Spruce and Pine Trees: for after two or
three hours fight, the Engliſh became Maſters of the place, but not judging
it tenable, after they had burned all they could ſet fire upon, they were
forced to retreat, after the Day-light was almoſt quite ſpent, and were
neceſſitated to retire to their quarters, full fifteen or ſixteen miles
off, ſome ſay more, whither with their Dead and Wounded men they were to
march, a difficulty ſcarce to be believed, as not to be paralleld almoſt in
any former age.</p>
            <p>It is hard to ſay who acquitted themſelves beſt in that
dayes ſervice, either the Souldiers for their manlike valour in fighting, or
the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders for their wiſdome and courage leading on in very face of
death; There might one have ſeen the whole Body of that little Regimental
Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as buſie as Bees in a Hive, ſome bravely fighting with the Enemy,
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haling off, and carrying away the Dead and Wounded Men (which I rather
note) that none may want the due teſtimony of their valour and
faithfulneſs, though all ought to ſay, <hi>not unto us, but unto thy Name,
O Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For though there might not be above three or four hundred at any 
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:171788:37"/> time within the Fort at once, yet the reſt in their
turns came up to do what the exigence of the ſervice required in bringing off
the Dead and Wounded men: The Major of the Regiment, together with Captain
<hi>Moſely,</hi> was very ſerviceable, for by that means the Fort being
clear of the Dead bodies, it ſtruck a greater terrour into the Enemy, to
ſee but eight or ten dead bodies of the Engliſh left, then to meet with
ſo many hundreds of their own ſlain and wounded Carkaſſes. The number
of the ſlain was not then known on the Enemies ſide, becauſe our Men were
forced to leave them on the ground: but our victory was found afterwards to be
much more conſiderable then at the firſt was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; for although our
loſs was very great, not only becauſe of the deſperateneſs of the
attempt it ſelf) in ſuch a ſeaſon of the year, and at ſuch a
diſtance from our quarters, whereby many of our wounded men periſhed, which
might otherwiſe have been preſerved, if they had not been forced to march
ſo many miles in a cold ſnowy night, before they could be dreſſed) yet
the Enemy loſt ſo many of their principal fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, their Proviſion
alſo was by the burning of their Wigwams, ſo much of it ſpoiled, at the
taking of their Fort, and by ſurprizing ſo much of their Corn about that
time alſo; that it was the occaſion of their total ruine afterwards: they
being at that time driven away from their habitations, and put by from Planting
for that next year, as well as deprived of what they had in ſtore for the
preſent winter. What num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Enemy were ſlain is uncertain, it was
confeſſed by one <hi>Potock</hi> a great Councellor amongſt them,
afterwards taken at <hi>Road-Iſland,</hi> and put to Death at
<hi>Boſton,</hi> that the Indians loſt ſeven hundred fighting men that
day, beſides three hundred that dyed of their Wounds the moſt of them: the
number of old men, women and children, that periſhed either by fire, or that
were ſtarved with hunger and cold, none of them could tell. There was above
eighty of the Engliſh ſlain, and a hundred and fifty wounded, that
recovered afterwards.</p>
            <p>There were ſeveral circumſtances in this Victory very
remarkable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The meeting with one <hi>Peter</hi> a fugitive
Indian, that upon ſome diſcontent, flying from the
<hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> offered himſelf to the ſervice of the Engliſh,
and did faithfully perform what he promiſed, <hi>viz.</hi> to lead them to
the Swamp where the Indians had ſeated themſelves within a Fort raiſed
upon an Iſland of firm Earth, in the midſt of a Swamp, whither none of the
Engliſh could have Piloted them, without his aſſiſtance, the place
being near eighteen miles from the place where they were quartered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There being by a ſpecial providence directed
juſt to a place <pb n="55" facs="tcp:171788:37"/> where they found ſo eaſie entrance,
which if they had miſſed they could never have made a way through the
Hedge, with which they had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded the Pallizadoes of the Fort in half a
dayes time.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If they had entred by the way left by the
Indians for paſſage, they might have been cut off, before they could have
come near their Fortification.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> In directing their motion, to begin the
Aſſault juſt at the day they did, for if they had deferred but a day
longer, there fell ſuch a ſtorm of Snow the next day, that they could not
have paſſed through it, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers weeks after: And then on the ſudden
there fell ſuch a Thaw, that melted away both Ice and Snow, ſo that if they
had deferred till that time, they could have found no paſſage into their
fortified place.</p>
            <p>All which conſiderations put together, make it a ſignal favour
of God to carry them through ſo many difficulties to accompliſh their
deſired end. For after they were retired from their quarters, but ſixteen
miles from that place, there was ſo great want of Proviſion, the
Veſſels being frozen in at the Harbour about <hi>Cape Cod,</hi> that
ſhould have brought them relief, and the Froſt and Snow ſet in ſo
violently, that it was not poſſible for them, with all the Force they could
make (ſo many of their ableſt Souldiers being ſlain and wounded) to have
made another onſet: But the goodneſs of Almighty God was moſt of all to
be admired, that notwithſtanding, all the hardſhip they indured that
winter, in very cold Lodgings, ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
Marches, Scarcity of Proviſion, yet not one man was known to dy by any
diſeaſe or bodily diſtemper, ſave them that periſhed of their
wounds.</p>
            <p>Our Forces being compelled by the foreſaid occaſions, to ly
ſtill ſome Weeks after, hoping alſo that the Enemy ſo ſorely broken,
would gladly have ſued for peace: But as was ſaid of old, <hi>God hardned
their hearts to their own ruine and deſtruction afterwards.</hi> For as
ſoon as our Souldiers were able to March, finding that all the Enemies
overtures of peace, and prolonging of treaties, was only to gain time that they

upon their Rear, but then they would immediately fly an hundred wayes at once
into Swamps, ſo as our men could not follow them, or if they did, could not

            <p>If there had not been ſo great a diſtance between the place of
the fight and their Quarters, and ſo much cold attending them in their
reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thereunto, ſome better account might have been given of that
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, then now they were able to do. For a March of ſixteen or
eighteen miles is too much to breathe a freſh Souldier, unleſs he were well
mounted, but enough to kill the heart of them that have been wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with a
long and tedious fight. As for the coldneſs of the weather, although it be a
good Be ſome to ſweep the Chamber of the Air (which might be the reaſon
there was no more Diſeaſes amongſt them) yet it is an unwelcome Companion
to wearied, eſpecially to wounded men, in ſo long a Retreat.</p>
            <p>But the want of Proviſion falling in conjunction with the
unſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of the Weather, and length of the way hindred our
Forces from <pb n="57" facs="tcp:171788:38"/> any new attempt upon the enemy, which if they
could have attended, it was thought it might have put an end to our troubles;
but he that hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſcales of victory in his hand, turneth them to which
ſide, and by what degrees pleaſeth himſelf beſt.</p>
            <p>The reſt of the winter was ſpent in fruitleſs Treaties about
a peace, both ſides being well wearied with the late deſperate Fight, were
willing to refreſh themſelves the remaining part of the winter, with the
ſhort ſlumber of a pretended peace, at leaſt with a talk or Dream
thereof: our Commanders aim therein was Chriſtian and good, if it had
proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>ſc.</hi> to have prevented the ſhedding of more bloud: And
poſſibly ſome of the elder and wiſer of the enemy, did really deſire
what was pretended by them all, (for they had now full proof of the valour and
reſolution of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which ſome of them upon former
ſucceſſes might be ready to queſtion) and they could not but ſee
their deſtruction already begun, in the loſs of their dwellings, and all
their proviſion, as well as the ſlaughter of the beſt part of their
fighting men; but either through conſciouſneſs of their barbarous
treachery, and falſhood they could not truſt others, and ſo were willing
to run the utmoſt hazard, as people hardned to their own deſtruction. The
particular paſſages of the treaty being carried on by the enemy only
impretence, and by our men (that ſoon diſcerned their fraud) rather out of
neceſſity, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal their incapacity of engaging them anew, then any
real expectation of a good effect, are not worthy the relating. However though
the Foot were unable to doe any Service in the depth of the ſnow, &amp;
ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the cold, The Troop was ſent out upon all occaſions to
ſcout a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Country, who brought in daily much of the enemies corn and
Beans, which they had hid in Barns under the ground, or at leaſt kept them
from making uſe of their own proviſion, or ſpoiling the Engliſh Cattle;
now and then alſo bringing in Priſoners from their Quarters, as they were
ſtragling about to get victuals.</p>
            <p>On the twenty ſeventh of <hi>December,</hi> Capt.
<hi>Prentice</hi> was ſent into <hi>Pom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ams Country,</hi> where they burnt near an hundred Wigwams, but
found never an <hi>Indian</hi> in any of them.</p>
            <p>On the 28<hi>th,</hi> of <hi>December</hi> a Squaw was ſent to
them, who had been taken in the Fight, with a proffer of Peace, if they would
ſubmit to ſuch Tearms as were propounded; the principal of which was, the
delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up all <hi>Philips</hi> Indians that were with them; The Squaw
returned not pretending that ſhe was lame and unable to come again, but the
thirtieth of <hi>December,</hi> an Indian came from the Sachems with ſeeming
thanks for the peace profered, yet complained, we made war upon them and gave 
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:171788:39"/> them no notice; but his mouth was ſoon ſtopped, by the
anſwer which was made him: he owned, as the Squaw had ſaid before, that
they loſt three hundred of their beſt fighting men, and ſo did two
Priſoners of theirs taken <hi>January</hi> the 4<hi>th,</hi> whereof one
being of <hi>Philips</hi> Company was put to death. The Meſſenger that was
ſent was fairly diſmiſſed, with the expreſs mention of what tearms
they muſt expect, if they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a peace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jan.</hi> There came two Meſſengers from them, as they
ſaid to make way for a treaty of Peace; who laid the blame upon
<hi>Canonchet,</hi> that came down to <hi>Boſton,</hi> in <hi>October</hi>
laſt, to confirm the peace with the Commiſſioners of the united Colonyes,
as if he had misinformed them, <hi>viz.</hi> that they were not by the former
treaty to have delivered up the <hi>Wompanoogs,</hi> or <hi>Philips
Indians,</hi> untill the ſaid <hi>Canonchets</hi> Brother one of the
Hoſtages at <hi>Hartford,</hi> was releaſed. This was but a meer pretence,
for he and they too better underſtood the particulars of the agreement: For
by chance the Articles which they had of the peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with them were
found open (whether purpoſely or accidentally was not known) in a Wigwam in
the Fort when it was taken, ſo as they could hot be ignorant of the Articles
of the Agreement</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jan.</hi> 5. An Engliſh child of about three or four years
old, taken from <hi>Warwick,</hi> was ſent in to put the better pretence upon
the treaty mentioned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jan.</hi> 8. The Meſſengers were ſent back, and told
what they muſt truſt to. In the afternoon a Meſſenger came from
<hi>Ninigret</hi> the old Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem of <hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> who brought a
letter from Mr. <hi>Stanton</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, ſignifying the reallity of
the ſaid <hi>Ninigret</hi> his friendſhip to the Engliſh, and the
ſtreights of the enemy, that corn was two ſhillings a pint with them. Yet
notwithſtanding all their difficultyes, they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delayed the time till
they could get away, then really endeavoured the making a peace, as was ſoon
manifeſt: For that young inſolent Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem <hi>Canonchet,</hi> and
<hi>Panoquin,</hi> ſaid they would fight it out to the laſt man, rather
then they would become Servants to the Engliſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jan.</hi> 10. Freſh ſupplyes of ſouldiers came up from
<hi>Boſton,</hi> wading through a ſharp ſtorm of ſnow, that bit ſome
of them by the heels with the froſt. The next day one that came with them
going out with the Scouts, fell amongſt the Indians Barns, in one of which,
as he was gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to find corn for the relief of his horſe, he catched hold
of an Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans hair under the leaves, who preſently held up his hands, when
the ſouldier was drawing his ſword, to ſpare his life, which was granted;
but after he was brought to the Head-quarters, he would owne nothing 
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:171788:39"/> but what was forced out of his mouth, by the woolding of
his head with a cord, wherefore he was preſently judged to dye as a
<hi>Wompanoog.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jan.</hi> 12. Another Meſſenger came from
<hi>Canonicus,</hi> deſiring the ſpace of a month longer, wherein to
iſſue the treaty, which ſo provoked the Commander of our Forces, that
they reſolved to have no more Treatyes with the enemy; but prepare to
aſſault them, with Gods aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as ſoon as ever the ſeaſon
would permit; and it was high time to take up that reſolution, for within a
few dayes after, they underſtood by ſome that were taken Priſoners; that
the enemy were gone, or going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Nipmuck Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Within a few dayes after, about the 16<hi>th. Jan.</hi> the
ſcouts brought in one <hi>Joſhuah Tift</hi> a Renegado Engliſh-man, of
<hi>Providence,</hi> that upon ſome diſcontent amongſt his neighbours,
had turned Indian, married one of the <hi>Indian Squaws,</hi> renounced his
Religion, nation and natural Parents all at once, fighting againſt them. He
was taken by Capt. <hi>Fenner</hi> of <hi>Providence,</hi> who with ſome of
his neighbours were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing ſome <hi>Indians</hi> that had driven away
their Cattle, This <hi>Tift</hi> being one of the Company was wounded in the
knee, and ſo was ſeized by the Engliſh he had in his habit conformed
himſelf to them amongſt whom he lived. After examination he was condemned
to dy the death of a Traitor. As to his Religion he was found as ignorant as an
Heathen, which no doubt cauſed the fewer tears to be ſhed at his Funeral,
ſtanders by being unwilling to laviſh pitty upon him that had diveſted
himſelf of nature it ſelf, as well as Religion, in a time when ſo much
pitty was needed elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and nothing left beſides wherewith to relieve
the Sufferers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jan.</hi> 21. Capt. <hi>Prentice</hi> his Troop being abroad
met with a Party of the enemy, of whom they took two Priſoners and killed
nine; in which exploit, ſomething hapned very remarkable, for one <hi>W.
Dodge</hi> of <hi>Salem</hi> riding in company with another Friend, they hapned
to meet with two Indians, the ſaid <hi>Dodge</hi> being better horſed then
his friend, made after the foremoſt, leaving his friend to deal with the
hindmoſt, but his Piſtol miſſed firing, whereupon the <hi>Indian</hi>
taking him by the leg turn'd him off his horſe, and getting upon him was
about killing him with his knife, which <hi>W. Dodge</hi> by chance eſpyed,
and came time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to reſcue his friend, and diſpatch the
<hi>Indian</hi> lying upon him, and yet overtook the firſt <hi>Indian</hi> he
was purſuing, time enough to doe his buſineſs alſo: by that meanes he
did three good offices at once, ſaved the life of one Friend, and ſlew two
of his Enemyes. But within two or three dayes after, the weather much altering
from what it was, induced our Forces to take the firſt opportunity to
purſue the enemy, who as they <pb n="60" facs="tcp:171788:40"/> underſtood by
Meſſengers from <hi>Providence,</hi> were now upon their flight into the
<hi>Nipmuck Country:</hi> But ſo many difficultyes were caſt in their way,
that they could not be ready time enough to prevent the miſchief they did at
<hi>Warwick,</hi> as they took their Farewell of their Country: For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jan.</hi> 27. They diſpoyled Mr. <hi>Carpenter</hi> of two
hundred ſheep, and fifty head of Neat Cattle, and fifteen horſes; all which
they drove along with them, and were gone too far to be reſcued before our
Forces ſet out. Two that belonged to the ſaid <hi>Carpenter</hi> were
wounded, and one of the enemies ſlain. As they marched after the enemy, they
found a good houſe burned, with a barn belonging to it. They perceived alſo
that the enemy dealt much in Horſe-fleſh, meeting with no leſs then
ſixty horſes heads, in one place which they had left behind them. Our
Souldiers in their purſuit came upon their Reer, killed and took about
ſeventy of them, yet never could come to charge them, for they would
preſently betake themſelves into Swamps, and not two of them run to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
ſo as they ſaw it was an endleſs work to proceed further in the chaſe
of ſuch an enemy; but our Forces having purſued them into the woods between
<hi>Marlborough</hi> and <hi>Brookfield</hi> in the Road toward
<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut,</hi> were conſtrained to turn down to <hi>Boſton</hi> in
the beginning of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> for want of proviſion, both for
themſelves and their horſes, which gave an occaſion to the loſſe of
thoſe leſſer Towns that were deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Napnet Indians</hi>
who preſently joyned with the <hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> upon their firſt
approach, as ſhall be related afterwards.</p>
            <p>About the tenth of <hi>February</hi> next, ſome hundreds of the
Indians whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Nipnets</hi> or <hi>Naſhaway</hi> men (is uncertain)
belonging to him, they call <hi>Sagamore Sam,</hi> and poſſibly ſome of
the ſtouteſt of the <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhaganſets</hi> that had eſcaped the Winter
brunt fell upon <hi>Lancaſter</hi> a ſmall Village of about fifty or
ſixty Families, and did much miſchief, burning moſt of the Houſes that
were not Gariſoned: and which is moſt ſad and awful to conſider, the
Houſe of Mr. <hi>Rowlandſon,</hi> Miniſter of the ſaid
<hi>Lancaſter,</hi> which was Gariſoned with a competent number of the
Inhabitants; yet the Fortification of the Houſe being on the back ſide,
cloſed up with Fire-wood, the Indians got ſo near, as to fire a Lean-too,
which burning the Houſe immediately to the ground, all the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
therein, were put to that hard choice, either to periſh by the flames with
the Houſe, or to yield themſelves into the hands of thoſe cruel
<hi>Salvages,</hi> which laſt (conſidering that a living Dog is better then
a dead Lyon) they choſe, and ſo were forty two perſons ſurpriſed by
the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, above twenty of the Women and Children they carried away Captive,
a rueful ſpectacle to behold, the reſt being Men, they killed in 
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:171788:40"/> the place, and reſerved for further miſery: and many
of the reſt were not ſlain in fighting, were killed in attempting to
eſcape. The Miniſter himſelf was occaſionally abſent, to ſeek help
from the Governour and Council, to defend that place, who returning, was
entertained with the Tragical news of his Wife and Children ſurprized, and
being carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the Enemies, and his Houſe turned into Aſhes, yet it
pleaſed God ſo to uphold his heart, comforting himſelf in his God, as
<hi>David</hi> at <hi>Zik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lag,</hi> that he would alwayes ſay, <hi>he
believed he ſhould ſee his Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren again,</hi> which did in like
manner ſoon come to paſs within five or ſix months after; all ſave the
youngeſt, which being wounded at the firſt, died ſoon after among the
Indians.</p>
            <p>And ſuch was the goodneſs of God to thoſe poor Captive
Women, and Children, that they found ſo much favour in the ſight of their
Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that they offered no wrong to any of their perſons, ſave what
they could not help, being in many wants themſelves. Neither did they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
any uncivil Carriage to any of the Females, nor ever attempted the chaſtity
of any of them, either being reſtrained of God, as was <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melek</hi> of
old, or by ſome other accidental cauſe, withheld them from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any wrong
in that kind.</p>
            <p>Upon the report of this Diſaſter Capt. <hi>Wadſworth</hi>
then at <hi>Malbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> with about forty reſolute men, adventuring the
reſcuing of the Town that was remaining: and having recovered a Bridge they
gat o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſafe, though the Planks were pulled off by the Enemy, and being led
up in a way, not diſcovered by them, they forced the Indians for the
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to quit the place, after they had burnt and deſtroyed the better
half of it. Yet afterwards it not being judged tenable, it was abandoned to the
pleaſure of the inſulting Foe.</p>
            <p>Ten dayes after they were ſo fluſhed with this ſucceſs,
that two or three hundred of them came wheeling down to <hi>Medfield</hi> a
Town twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty miles from <hi>Boſton,</hi> weſtward from <hi>Dedham,</hi>
which they ſurprized ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry early in the morning (and though there were one
hundred and ſixty Souldiers in it or more, beſides the Inhabitants) they
burnt near one half of the Town, killing about twenty perſons, but by the
reſiſtance of the Souldiers, as ſoon as ever they could be gotten
together (it being at or before break of day, none in the leaſt ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> having been dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of the Country, fled through
<hi>Nipnet Plantations,</hi> towards <hi>Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſet Hills</hi> meeting with
all the Indians that had harboured all Winter in thoſe Woods about
<hi>Naſhaway,</hi> they all combined together againſt the Engliſh, yet
divided their numbers, and one half of them were obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to bend their
courſe toward <hi>Plimouth,</hi> taking <hi>Medfield</hi> in their way, which
they endeavoured to burn and ſpoile, <hi>Feb,</hi> 21. 1675. as their fellows
had done <hi>Lancaſter</hi> ten dayes before.</p>
            <p>The ſurprizal of this <hi>Medfield</hi> in regard of ſome
remarkable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances it was attended with, is not unworthy a more
particular Relating the manner thereof: the loſs of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> had
ſufficiently awakened and alarmed the neighbouring Villages, all to ſtand
upon their guard; and ſome had obtained Gariſon Souldiers for their greater
ſecurity, as was the caſe with the Town of <hi>Medfield,</hi> within twenty
two miles of <hi>Boſton.</hi> And at that time were lodged therein ſeveral
Gariſon Souldiers, beſides the Inhabitants; yet being billated up &amp;
down in all quarters of the town could not be gathered together till a great
part of the Town was ſet on fire, and many of the Inhabitants ſlain, which
how it could be effected is ſtrange to believe: But moſt of thoſe inland
Plantations being over run with young wood (the Inhabitants being every where
apt to engroſs more Land into their hands then they were able to ſubdue) as
if they were ſeated in the midſt of a heap of Buſhes: their Enemies took
the advantage thereof, and ſecretly over night, conveyed themſelves round
about the Town, ſome getting under the ſides of their Barns and fences of
their Orchards, as is ſuppoſed, where they lay hid under that covert, till
break of day, when they ſuddenly ſet upon ſundry Houſes, ſhooting
them that came firſt out of their doors, and then fired their Houſes,
eſpecially thoſe houſes where the Inhabitants were repaired to
Gariſons, were fit for the purpoſe: ſome were killed as they attempted to
fly to their Neigbours for ſhelter: ſome were only wounded, and ſome
taken alive and carried Captive: in ſome Houſes the Husband running away
with one childe, the wife with another, of whome the one was killed, the other
eſcaped: they began at the Eaſt end of the Town where they fired the
Houſe of one <hi>Samuel Morſe,</hi> that ſeems to have been a ſignal to
the reſt to fall on in other parts: moſt of the Houſes in the Weſt or
Southweſt end of the Town were ſoon burnt down: and generally when they
burnt any out-houſes, the Cattle in them were burnt alſo. Two Mills
belonging to the Town were burnt alſo: a poor old man of near an hundred
years old, was burnt in one of the Houſes that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed 
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:171788:41"/> by fire. The Lieutenant of the Town, <hi>Adams</hi> by
name, was ſhot down by his own door, and his Wife mortally wounded by a Gun
fired afterwards accidentally in the Houſe. After the burning of forty or
fifty houſes and barns, the <hi>Cannibals</hi> were frighted away out of the
Town over a Bridge that lies upon <hi>Charls-River,</hi> by the ſhooting off
a piece of Ordnance 2 or 3 times: when they had paſſed over the Bridge they
fired one end thereof, to hinder our men from purſuing them, they were
thought to be above five hundred: There were ſlain and mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded
ſeventeen or eighteen perſons, beſides others dangerouſly hurt. The
loſs ſuſtained by the Inhabitants amounted to above two thouſand
pounds. This mercy was obſerved in this ſad providence, that never a
Gariſon houſe was loſt in this ſurpriſal; nor any of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Dwellings, ſo as the chiefeſt and beſt of their Building eſcaped the
fury of the Enemy, who as they paſſed the Bridge left a writing behind
them, expreſſing ſomething to this purpoſe, that we had provoked them
to wrath, and that they would fight with us this twenty years (but they fell
ſhort of their expectation by nineteen) adding alſo, that they had nothing
to looſe, whereas we had Houſes, Barns and Corn: theſe were ſome of the
bold threats uſed by the barbarous crew, but their rage ſhall proceed no
further then the counſel of God had determined. The week before was heard a
very hideous cry of a kennel of Wolves round the Town, which raiſed ſome of
the Inhabitants, and was looked upon by divers as an ominous preſaging of
this following Calamity.</p>
            <p>Another aſſault was feared, but as ſoon as the Souldiers
could be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, they turned their backs, as if they never intended
to viſit them more: whether theſe Indians went when they left
<hi>Medfield</hi> is not ſo certainly known; the Souldiers in the Town not
having oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to purſue them over the River, by reaſon that the
Bridge was part of it burned: but it is moſt probable that they took their
way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and continued about that ſide of the Country
for the future, waiting opportunities to do what miſchief they could to the
En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh in thoſe parts: For within a month after this aſſault of
<hi>Medfield,</hi> there was near ſix hundred of them ſeen about
<hi>Patuxit</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> where Capt. <hi>Pierce</hi> with
about fifty of his men were loſt, though with no great advantage to the
Enemy, who at that time loſt above double that number: our worthy Captains in
this and other exploits being called to imitate <hi>Sampſon,</hi> who was
content to dye with his enemies, that he might overthrow them thereby: it
having ſo fallen out with many of our choice Commanders and Souldiers at
<hi>Deerfield, Narrhaganſet, Patuxit,</hi> and likewiſe not long after at
<hi>Sudbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:171788:42"/>The Governour and Council of <hi>Plimouth</hi>
perceiving by the report of theſe outrages committed upon the Towns of the
<hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> that they were like to be viſited this Spring by
their old Neighbours, ſent out Capt. <hi>Peirce</hi> of <hi>Scituate</hi>
about the latter end of <hi>March,</hi> with about fifty Engliſh, and twenty
of their Chriſtian Indians about <hi>Cape Cod,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved none of his
worſt Souldiers, as the ſequel of this his laſt expedition will
declare.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Pierce,</hi> as is ſaid before, being ſent out to
purſue the Enemy, marched towards <hi>Patuxit,</hi> where he underſtood the
Indians were many of them gathered together: he being a man of reſolute
courage, was willing to engage them though upon never ſo great
diſadvantage: ſome ſay the Indians by counterfeiting, drilled him into a
kind of Ambuſh, poſſibly more of them diſcovered themſelves after he
began to engage then he was aware of: and being gotten over the River in
purſuit of them, where he diſcovered ſo great a number of them, he drew
down towards the ſide of the River, hoping the better by that means to
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their ſurrounding of him, but that proved his overthrow, which he
intended as his greateſt advantage: for the Indians getting over the River,
ſo galled him from thence, that he was not able to defend himſelf thus
aſſaulted on all ſides, &amp; himſelf not being able to travel much a
foot, was thereby hindred from retiring to any better place in time; ſo as he
ſaw himſelf conſtrained to fight it out to the laſt, which he did with
moſt undaunted Courage, &amp; as is ſaid, to the ſlaughter of an hundred
&amp; forty of his enemies, before himſelf and his Company were cut off. It
is ſaid alſo that being apprehenſive of the danger he was in, by the
great numbers of the enemy, like to overpovver him vvith their multitude, he
ſent a Meſſenger timely enungh to <hi>Providence,</hi> for relief, but,
as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>A faithful Meſſenger is as Snow in
harveſt, another is as ſmoak to the eyes and vinegar to the teeth.</hi>
(vvhether through ſloth or Covvardize, is not much material) this meſſage
vvas not delivered to them to vvhom it vvas immediately ſent; by accident
only ſome of <hi>Rehoboth</hi> underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the danger after the
evening exerciſe (it being on the Lords day, <hi>March</hi> 26. 1676.)
repaired to the place, but then it was too late to bring help, unleſs it
vvere to be Spectators of the dead Carkaſes of their friends, and to perform
the laſt office of love to them.</p>
            <p>It is vvorth the noting, vvhat faithfulneſs and courage ſome
of the Chriſtian <hi>Indians</hi> vvith the ſaid Capt. <hi>Pierce</hi>
ſhevved in the Fight: one of them, <hi>Amos</hi> by name, after the Captain
vvas ſhot in his leg or thigh, ſo as he was not able to ſtand any longer,
would not leave him, but charging his gun ſeveral times, fired ſtoutly upon
the enemy, till he <pb n="65" facs="tcp:171788:42"/> ſaw that there was no poſſibility
for him to do any further good to Capt. <hi>Pierce,</hi> nor yet to ſave
himſelf; if he ſtayed any longer; therefore he uſed this policy,
perceiving the Enemy had all blacked their faces, he alſo ſtooping down,
pulled out ſome blacking out of a pouch he carried with him, diſcoloured
his face therewith, and ſo making himſelf look as like <hi>Hobamacko</hi>
as any of his Enemies: he ran amongſt them a little while and was taken for
one of themſelves, as if he had been ſearching for the Engliſh, until he
had an opportunity to eſcape away among the Buſhes: therein imitating the
Cuttle Fiſh, which when it is purſued, or in danger, caſteth out of its
body a thick humor, as black as Ink, through which it paſſes away unſeen
by the purſuer.</p>
            <p>It is reported of another of theſe <hi>Cape Indians</hi>
(Friends to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh of <hi>Plimouth</hi>) that being purſued by one of
the Enemies, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himſelf to a great Rock, where he ſheltred
himſelf for a while, at laſt perceiving that his Enemy lay ready with his
Gun on the other ſide, to diſcharge upon him, as ſoon as he ſtir'd
never ſo little away from the place where he ſtood: in the iſſue he
thought of this politick Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem to ſave himſelf, and deſtroy his
Enemy, (for as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid of old, <hi>Wiſdome is better then
Weapons of War:</hi>) he took a ſtick, and hung his Hat upon it, and then by
degrees gently lifted it up, till he thought it would be ſeen, and ſo
become a fit mark for the other that watched to take aym at him: the other
taking it to be his head, fired a Gun, and ſhot through the Hat; which our
Chriſtian Indian perceiving, boldly held up his head and diſcharged his own
Gun upon the real head, not the hat of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, whereby he ſhot him
dead upon the place, and ſo had liberty to march away with the ſpoils of of
his Enemy.</p>
            <p>The like ſubtle device was uſed by another of the <hi>Cape
Indians</hi> at the ſame time, being one of them that went out with Capt.
<hi>Pierce;</hi> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in like manner purſued by one of <hi>Philips
Indians,</hi> as the former was, he nimbly got behind the but end of a Tree
newly turned up by the roots, which carried a conſiderable breadth of the
ſurface of the Earth along with it (as is very uſual in theſe parts,
where the roots of the Trees ly very fleet in the ground) which ſtood up
above the Indians height, in form of a large Shield, only it was ſomewhat too
heavy to be eaſily weilded, or removed: the Enemy Indian lay with his Gun
ready to ſhoot him down, upon his firſt diſſerting his ſtation; but a
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle wit taught our Chriſtian <hi>Netop</hi> a better device, for boring
a little hole through this his broad Shield, he diſcerned his enemy, who
could not ſo eaſily diſcern him; a good Musketier need never deſire a
fairer mark to ſhoot at, whereupon diſcharging his Gun, he ſhot him down:
what can be more juſt then that he ſhould himſelf be killed who 
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:171788:43"/> lay in wait to kill another man? 
<q>

dexterouſneſs of theſe Natives, if they were improved in feats of Arms:
and poſſibly if ſome of the Engliſh had not been too ſhye in making
uſe of ſuch of them as were well affected to their intereſt, they need
never have ſuffered ſo much from their enemies: it having been found upon
late experience, that many of them have proved not only faithful, but very
ſerviceable and helpful to the engliſh; they uſually proving good
Seconds, though they have not ordinarily confidence enough to make the firſt
Onſet.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feb.</hi> 25. They aſſaulted <hi>Weymouth,</hi> and burned
ſeven or eight houſes &amp; barns there, which <hi>Weymouth</hi> is a town
lying towards <hi>Plimouth Colony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 12. following, They aſſaulted the houſe of
one Mr. <hi>Clark</hi> in <hi>Plimouth,</hi> cruelly murthering eleven
perſons that belonged to two Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies that lodged therein, and then fired
the houſe. The cruelty towards theſe perſons was the more remarkable, in
that they had often received much kindneſs from the ſaid <hi>Clarke.</hi>
It is the uſual cuſtome of ſuch Debtors, to uſe them worſt, of whom
they have taken up much kindneſs upon truſt before hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 17<hi>th.</hi> Another party of them fell upon
<hi>Warwick,</hi> a place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Philips</hi> Land; toward the
<hi>Narrhaganſet Country,</hi> where they burnt down to the ground all but a
few houſes, left ſtanding as a Monument of their barbarous fury. The like
miſchief was acted by them upon the houſes of the Engliſh remaining in
the <hi>Narrhaganſet Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This 26 of <hi>March</hi> being the firſt day of the week, as
the firſt of the year after our <hi>Julian</hi> account, ſeemed ominous at
the firſt on ſundry ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, threatning a gloomy time, yet proved in the
iſſue, but as a lour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing morning before a lightſome day:</p>
            <p>For beſides the burning of <hi>Marlburrough,</hi> at leaſt a
great part of it on the ſame day; a very ſad accident fell out the ſame
time at <hi>Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> as ſhall he ſpecified hereafter; beſides
that which befell Captain <hi>Pierce,</hi> which is already related, with whom
fell ſo many of his Souldiers on the ſame day alſo: yet had the Enemy no
cauſe to boaſt, being forced by the valour of the Engliſh, to give ſo
many of their own lives in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change: ſome few made their eſcape, as is
ſaid by ſubtle devices: beſides the three forementioned, another by a
like ſhift, not only ſaved himſelf, but helped an Engliſh man to
eſcape alſo, whom he ran after with his Hatchet in his hand, as if he were
about to kill him; whereby both of them made a ſhift to get away; the reſt
were all loſt (the unfaithfulneſs of the Meſſenger being as was
intimated before, <pb n="67" facs="tcp:171788:43"/> the cauſe of their ſlaughter) unto a
few that hardly eſcaped by the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the buſhes, giving them
opportunity to paſs unſeen, yet was it confeſſed by a Priſoner of the
enemy, taken afterward by the Engliſh, that they loſt an hundred and forty
in that encounter. And had not the ſaid Engliſh by wading after the enemy
over a River, made their amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition uſeleſs, there had not half ſo many
of them been cut off. From thence they turned back towards <hi>Rehoboth</hi>
near <hi>Swanzy,</hi> where on <hi>March.</hi> 28. they burnt thirty Barns, and
near upon forty dwelling hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, thereby as it were threatning the utter
deſolation of that poor town; and ſo proceeding on that ſide the Country,
they burnt the very next day about thirty houſes in <hi>Providence</hi> in
the way toward <hi>Narrhaganſet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it was now full ſea with <hi>Philip</hi> his affairs, for
ſoon after the tide of his ſucceſſes began to turn about the Sea
coaſt, which made way for the falling of the water up higher in the Country.
For about this time newes came to <hi>Boſton</hi> that our neighbours and
friends of <hi>Connecticut Colony</hi> hearing of the attempts of the enemy on
that ſide of the Country, ſent a party of their Souldiers, under the
Command of Capt. <hi>George De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſon</hi> with ſome friendly Indians, part
<hi>Mohegins</hi> and <hi>Pequods,</hi> part <hi>Nian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks</hi> belonging to
<hi>Ninigret</hi> a <hi>Narrhaganſet Sachem,</hi> who never engaged in this
quarrell againſt the Engliſh: who in purſuit of the enemy; meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with
a conſiderable part of them about the <hi>Narrhaganſet Country,</hi> killed
and took forty and five of them, without the loſs of one of their own men.
This Victory was the more conſiderable, in that ſeveral of the chief
Captains of the enemy were at this time killed or taken; amongſt whom was
<hi>Canonehet</hi> (who came down to got ſeed-corn to plant at
<hi>Squakheag</hi>) he was the chief Sachem of all the
<hi>Narrhaganſets:</hi> the ſon of <hi>Miantonimoh,</hi> and the heir of
all his fathers pride and inſolency, as well as of his malice againſt the
Engliſh, a moſt perfidious villain, who had the laſt <hi>October</hi>
been at <hi>Boſton,</hi> pretending to make a firm peace with the Engliſh,
but never intending to keep one Article thereof: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as a juſt reward
of his wickedneſs was he adjudged by thoſe that took him to dye, which was
accordingly put in execution at <hi>Stonington,</hi> whither he was carryed:
There his head being cut off was carried to <hi>Hartford:</hi> The
<hi>Mohegins</hi> and <hi>Pequods</hi> that had the honour to take him
priſoner, having the honour likewiſe of doing juſtice upon him, &amp;
that by the prudent advice of the Engliſh Commanders, thereby the more firmly
to engage the ſaid Indians againſt the treacherous
<hi>Narrhaganſets.</hi> There are differing reports about the manner of his
taking, and by whom, whither the Indians or the Engliſh firſt took him,
however it was ſufficient matter of rejoycing to all the Colonyes of the
Engliſh, <pb n="68" facs="tcp:171788:44"/> that the Ring-leader of almoſt all this
miſchief, and great Incendiary betwixt the <hi>Narhaganſets</hi> and us,
dyed himſelf by that ſword of warre which he had drawn againſt
others.</p>
            <p>Not long after Capt. <hi>George Deniſon</hi> of
<hi>Stonington,</hi> with ſixty ſix Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteirs, and an hundred and twelve
<hi>Pequods,</hi> killed and took ſeventy &amp; ſix of the enemy, amongſt
whom were two <hi>Narrhaganſet</hi> Sachems, one of which was the Grand-child
of <hi>Pomham</hi> (who is accounted the moſt warlike and the beſt
ſouldier of all the <hi>Narrhaganſet Sachems</hi>) taking at the ſame
time 160. buſhels of the enemyes corn, no ſmall damage to our Enemies at
that time, and all this without the loſs of one man of the ſaid Captains
followers.</p>
            <p>The greateſt miſchief which after this time was done by the
enemy in <hi>Plimouth Colony,</hi> was by burning of houſes and barns, which
they might eaſily doe, the Inhabitants in moſt of thoſe Towns being
repaired to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon houſes for their greater ſecurity: For about the
20<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> fifty of the enemy burnt about nineteen
houſes and barns at <hi>Scituate,</hi> but were ſo reſolutely encountred
by a few of the Inhabitants, that they were driven away, and thereby prevented
from doing of further miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
            <p>Not long after, <hi>May.</hi> 8. they burned about ſeventeen
houſes and barns in <hi>Bridge-water,</hi> a ſmall town in <hi>Plimouth
Colony,</hi> twenty ſeven miles on this ſide <hi>Taunton,</hi> but it
pleaſed God juſt at the time to ſend a Thunder-ſhower, which put out
the fire, or elſe it might have prevailed much further.</p>
            <p>It is very remarkable, that the Inhabitants of the ſaid
<hi>Bridge-water</hi> never yet loſt one perſon by the ſword of the
enemy, though the town is ſcituate within <hi>Plimouth Colony,</hi> yet have
they helped to deſtroy many of the enemy. <hi>None knowes either love or
hatred by all that is before them</hi> in things of this nature: nor ought
ſtanders by that may eſcape think, themſelves leſs ſinners then
thoſe that ſo periſh by the ſword of the enemy: Yet about this time
four of the Inhabitants of <hi>Taunton</hi> were killed, as they were at their
work in the field, whereby it is ſaid, thirty children were made
Fatherleſs: <hi>So unſearchable are the judgments of the Almighty, and his
wayes paſt finding out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During theſe Calamities, Gods Diſpenſations have been very
various, as well in reference unto Towns and Villages, as unto perſons: As if
ſome places had been by ſpecial providence marked out to preſervation, as
others unto deſtruction; of which no other reaſon can be rendred according
unto man, then the good pleaſure of God ſo to order and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of
events, which <hi>ſometimes</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays <hi>are all one
to the good, and to the clean, and to the unclean.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:171788:44"/>And becauſe ſpecial notice is taken of the
Town of <hi>Bridge-water,</hi> the which although it is ſeated, as it were,
in the midſt of danger, and hath been often aſſaulted by conſiderable
numbers of the Enemy, yet never loſt any one of their Inhabitants, young or
old; a particular account ſhall here be given of the moſt remarkable
paſſages of divine providence relating to that Plantation ſince the War
began. <hi>June</hi> 26. 1675 When <hi>Philips</hi> malice againſt the
Engliſh, mixed with a particular prejudice againſt Governour
<hi>Winſlow,</hi> began to boyl up to the height of an open Rebellion, the
people of <hi>Swanzy</hi> being like to be diſtreſſed by the Indians, a
Poſt was inſtantly ſent to the Governour of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> the way
lying through <hi>Bridge-water,</hi> the ſaid Poſt returned the next day:
and about 9 or 10 of the clock, as he paſſed through the Town, left an
Order from the Governour for the raiſing of twenty men, well armed and
furniſhed with Horſes, to be forthwith diſpatched away for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of
<hi>Swanzy;</hi> ſeventeen were all that could be raiſed on the ſudden,
who were ſent thither that night, and were the firſt that were upon their
march in all the Country; and poſſibly they fared not the worſe for their
forwardneſs: as <hi>Deborah</hi> the Propheteſs, bleſſed God for, them
<hi>that offered themſelves willingly among the People:</hi> Theſe
ſeventeen of <hi>Bridge-water</hi> were <hi>June</hi> 21. ordered by Capt.
<hi>Bradford</hi> to <hi>Metapoiſit</hi> a place at twelve miles diſtance
from <hi>Swanzy,</hi> to ſtrengthen the Gariſon at one <hi>Bourns</hi>
Houſe, wherein were ſeventy perſons, amongſt whom were only found
ſixteen men. After they had marched five miles of their way, having Mr.
<hi>Browns</hi> Son for their Pilot, they met with ſome <hi>Swan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy</hi>
people, newly turned out of their Houſes (by which they were to paſs) who
having not as yet reſiſted unto Blood, yet made doleful la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations,
wringing of their hands; and bewailing of their loſſes, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much alſo
perſwading <hi>Bridge-water</hi> men to turn back, becauſe of the danger,
but they having ſo clear a call, had alſo more courage, then cowardly to
deſert the cauſe of God and his People, leſt they ſhould thereby betray
the lives of ſo many of their friends into the Enemies hands; and ſo by the
good hand of God towards them, came ſafe to <hi>Metapoiſet</hi> that
night.</p>
            <p>The next day in the morning, a part of them went to guard Mr.
<hi>Brown</hi> their Pilot back to his quarters; in their return they came
ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly upon a party of Indians, about thirty in all; they were within
ſhot one of another, but the Engliſh having no Commiſſion to fight,
till they were aſſaulted, and not being impeached in their paſſage,
they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ſafe to their Gariſon at <hi>Metapoiſet:</hi> the Indians
preſently draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off, and firing three Guns (though not with intent to do
them any <pb n="70" facs="tcp:171788:45"/> hurt, as was conceived) gave a ſhout, and ſo
left them, when this party of the Engliſh drew near to their Gariſon, they
met with a company of Carts going to fetch Corn from an houſe deſerted near
by, about a quarter of a mile off from Mr. <hi>Bournes</hi> Houſe, the
Souldiers gave them notice of the Indians which they had diſcovered, and
withal adviſed them by no means to venture any more, becauſe of the danger;
but they were reſolved notwithſtanding theſe earneſt perſwaſions of
the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to have another turn, which they ſoon found to be to the peril
of their own lives, ſix of them being preſently after either killed right
out, or mortally wounded, as ſoon as they came to the Barn where was the
Corn; theſe ſix are ſaid to be the firſt that were ſlain in this
quarrel. The Souldiers at the Gariſon hearing the Guns, made what haſte
they could to the place, but being moſt of them in that interim, gone to look
their Horſes they could not come time enough to the relief of their friends,
yet upon their approach, they who had done the miſchief pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fled
away: one <hi>Jones</hi> hard purſued by two Indians was by their coming
delivered from the extent of the Enemies cruelty, but having received his
mortal wound, had only that favour thereby, to dy in the Arms of his friends,
though by the wounds received from his Enemies.</p>
            <p>The next week, fifteen of thoſe Souldiers looking after their
Horſes, fell into an Ambuſh of twenty of the Indians, but being prepared
for the encounter, they diſcharged their Guns upon each other: but our men
received no hurt, ſome of them felt the winde of the bullets paſſing by
their faces; what damage the Enemy received is uncertain, yet ſome of the
Engliſh report they found ſome of their enemies dead bodies in the place
afterward.</p>
            <p>Thus were they not only preſerved in many perils themſelves,
but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came inſtrumental alſo; for the preſervation of moſt of that
Gariſon, who with their goods by their means, with the help of a ſmall
party of <hi>Plimouth</hi> Forces ſent thither after the ſix were killed
(as is mentioned before) were ſoon after tranſported ſafely to <hi>Roud
Iſland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many outrages were that Summer committed upon their Neighbours at
<hi>Taunton</hi> and <hi>Namasket,</hi> yet it pleaſed God to protect this
poor Town of <hi>Bridge-water</hi> from any other hurt; till the beginning of
<hi>April</hi> next, when themſelves with their Neighbours of
<hi>Taunton</hi> and <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> were ſtrongly ſolicited to deſert
their Dwellings, and repair down to the Towns by the Sea ſide, but God
encouraged them to keep their ſtations notwithſtanding the extream danger
then preſented. It is reported that <hi>Philip</hi> gave order that
<hi>Taunton</hi> and <hi>Bridge-water</hi> ſhould not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed till
the laſt, which is all the favour to be expected from an enemy, 
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:171788:45"/> but theſe things are only in the hands of God, and not
to be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 9. being Lords day, A ſmall party of the Enemy
came down upon the ſaid <hi>Bridge-water,</hi> burnt an out-houſe and barn,
broke up and rifled ſeveral other houſes in the ſame quarter of the Town,
which are notwithſtanding yet remaining; they ſent out a party of their men
to purſue them that night, and many dayes after, but could not hear of
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 7. the Lords day alſo (no doubt but the
betterneſs of the day, will increaſe the badneſs of their deed attempted
thereon) they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of a great body of Indians diſperſed that
way, with intent to have fallen upon the Town that very day, but were
caſually prevented by a great deal of rain that fell the night before:
however they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to foreſlow no opportunity, wherefore on the
next day (<hi>May</hi> 8. about three hundred of them, one <hi>Tiſguogen</hi>
being their chief Leader, at 8 or 9 in the morning made an aſſault upon the
eaſt end of the Town, on the South ſide of the River: many of the
Inhabitants ſtayed at home that morning becauſe of the intelligence the day
before, and ſo were the more ready to entertain them; ſome that not taking
that warning vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the field about their occaſions, were in danger
of ſurprizal, but by the ſpecial favour of God, eſcaped, and came time
enough to help de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their own and their neighbours dwellings, being ſhot
at, and hard purſued a conſiderable way.</p>
            <p>The Indians preſently began to fire the town, but it pleaſed
God ſo to ſpirit and encourage ſeveral of the Inhabitants, iſſuing
out of their Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon houſes; that they fell upon them with great
reſolution, and beat them off; at the ſame inſtant of time, the Lord of
Hoſts alſo fighting for them from heaven, by ſending a ſtorm of thunder
and rain very ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, which prevented the burning of the houſes
which were fired: The Souldiers alſo fighting under the banner of Gods
ſpecial protection were ſo ſucceſsful in repelling the Enemy, that they
neither had any of the Inhabitants killed or taken, and but one wounded. The
Indians by this ſtout reſiſtance, being beaten off to the skirts of the
Town, made a freſh onſet upon another quarter thereof, on the north ſide
of the River where they had done much more miſchief, but that God ſtirred
up ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of the people to venture out of their fortified houſes, who
fired upon the enemy, and beat them from their dwellings, ſo as in the
evening they drew off to an out-houſe, three miles diſtant from the town:
the next day the Inhabitants expected another aſſault, but the enemy having
burned the houſe &amp; barn, where they kept their Rendezvouze over night,
&amp; one <pb n="72" facs="tcp:171788:46"/> houſe more not far diſtant, they marched all
clear away for that time.</p>
            <p>Thus it pleaſed God ſo to order his diſpenſations, toward
this ſmall Town, as a brand plucked out of the fire, that they did but juſt
taſte of this bitter cup, which others drank deeper of; yet had they not
ſuch mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as theſe had, mixed therewith: under God, the courage of the
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants was a great means of their preſervation, for they fired ſo
ſtoutly upon the Enemies, that they durſt not come very near any of the
Gariſoned Houſes, ſaluting them only at a diſtance. God was eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſeen upholding the ſpirits of all ſorts, men and women, ſo as no
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation of minde was ſeen upon any of them, during the whole time of
the diſpute.</p>
            <p>In this aſſault they loſt but thirteen dwelling-houſes,
whereof five only were in the Town (the reſt being out-houſes and
deſerted for the preſent) with ſome few Barns, and ſome of their
Cattle; all which was a very inconſiderable loſs, in compariſon of what
befell others, and themſelves might have endured, if God had not by his
ſpecial favour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 14, <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. Another party of Indians came
down upon the North-weſt ſide of the Town, but with no better ſucceſs;
for they had no Commiſſion from the Lord of Hoſts to touch any of the
perſons of the Inhabitants, their power reaching only to the ſlaying of
their Cattle at this time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>July</hi> 18, 19, 20. They ſent our parties after the Enemy
to purſue them by their Track, who fell upon ſome of them. On the twentieth
they took ſixteen, whereof two were men: on this day they had to aſſiſt
them, it ſeems ſome of the Bay Indians ſent them from Captain
<hi>Brattle;</hi> ſome of the Captives informed, that there were but 70 or
80. in the Company, and but ten or twelve men amongſt them: but within a few
dayes, theſe <hi>Bridge-water-men,</hi> ſhall finde better ſucceſs in
purſuit of their Enemies, when <hi>Philip</hi> himſelf ſhall hardly
eſcape their hands as ſhall be ſeen afterwards.</p>
            <p>While one party of the Enemy thus acted their part in and about
<hi>Plimouth Colony.</hi> towards the Sea-coaſt, other parties of them were
not idle in the <hi>Maſſachuſets Colony,</hi> where they aſſaulted
many places, doing what miſchief they could by firing of Houſes, and
killing ſeveral perſons in the inland Plantations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 2. They aſſaulted <hi>Groton:</hi> the next day
over night Major <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard</hi> with ſeventy Horſe came into the Town;
forty Foot alſo came up to their relief from <hi>Watertown,</hi> but the
Indians were all fled, having firſt burned all the Houſes in the Town,
ſave four that were Gariſoned, <pb n="73" facs="tcp:171788:46"/> the Meeting-houſe
being the ſecond houſe they fired, Soon after Capt. <hi>Sill</hi> was
ſent with a ſmall Party of Dragoons of 8 Files to fetch off the
Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Groton,</hi> and what was left from the ſpoyle of the
enemy, having under his conduct about ſixty Carts, being in depth from front
to reer above two mile: when a party of Indians lying in ambuſh, at a place
of eminent advantage, fired upon the front and mortally wounded two of the
vaunt Carriers, who dyed both the next night; and might (had God permitted)
have done eminent damage to the whole Body, it being a full hour before the
whole Body could be drawne up, which was done with care and Courage: but the
Indians after a few more ſhot made. without doing harm, retired, and made no
further aſſault upon them, being the ſame Party of <hi>Indians</hi> which
the day before had burned ſome part of <hi>Chelmsford.</hi> Soon after this
Village was deſerted and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the enemy: yet was it a ſpecial
providence, that though the carts were guarded with ſo ſlender a Convoy,
yet there was not any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable loſs ſuſtained.</p>
            <p>The Surprizall of <hi>Groton</hi> was after this manner.</p>
            <p>On <hi>March,</hi> 2. The Indians came in the night and rifled
eight or nine houſes and carried away ſome cattle, and alarmed the
Town.</p>
            <p>On <hi>March,</hi> 9. About ten in the morning, a parcel of
<hi>Indians</hi> (having two dayes lurked in the town, and taken
poſſeſſion of three out-houſes and feaſted themſelves with corn,
divers ſwine and poultry which they there ſeized) laid an ambuſh for two
Carts, which went from their ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon to fetch in ſome hay, attended with
four men, two of which eſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the enemy, made a difficult eſcape, the
other two were ſet upon, and one of them ſlain, ſtript naked, his body
mangled, and dragged into the high-way, and laid on his back in a moſt
ſhamefull manner: the other taken Captive; and after ſentenced to death,
but the enemy not concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the manner of it, execution was deferred, and
he by the providence of God eſcaped by a bold attempt the night before he was
deſigned to ſlaughter, and fled to the Gariſon at <hi>Lancaſter,</hi>
the cattle in both towns wounded, and five of them ſlain outright.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March,</hi> 13. Was the day when the enemy came in a full
body, by there own account 400. and thought by the Inhabitants to be not many
fewer. The town was at this time (having been put into a fright by the ſad
Cataſtrophe of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> the next bordering town) gathered into
five Gariſons, four of which were ſo near together, as to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to
command from one to the other, between which were the cattle belonging to
thoſe Families driven into paſtures, which afterward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their
preſervation; the other was near a mile diſtant from the reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:171788:47"/>This morning the <hi>Indians</hi> (having in
the night placed themſelves in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of the town) made their
Onſet; which began near the four Gariſons; for a body of them having placed
themſelves in Ambuſcado, behind a hill, near one of the Gariſons, two of
them made diſcovery of themſelves, as if they had ſtood upon diſcovery.
At this time divers of the people, nothing ſuſpecting any ſuch matter
(for the day before, many had been upon diſcovery many miles, and found no
ſigns of an Enemy being ſo near) were attending their occaſions, ſome
foddering their cattle, ſome milking their Cows, of whom the Enemy might
eaſily have made a ſeizure, but God prevented; they having another deſign
in hand, as ſoon after appeared: Theſe two Indians were at length eſpyed,
and the Alarm given; whereupon the moſt of the men in the next Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and ſome alſo of the ſecond (which was about eight or nine pole
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant) drew out and went to ſurprize theſe two <hi>Indians,</hi> who
kept their ſtation till our men reached the brow of the hill, then aroſe
the ambuſh and diſcharged a volley upon them, which cauſed a diſorderly
retreat, or rather a rout, in which one was ſlain, and three others wounded:
mean while another ambuſh had riſen, and come upon the back ſide of the
Gariſon ſo deſerted of men, and pulled down the Palizadoes: The Souldiery
in this rout, retreated not to their own, but paſſed by to the next
Gariſon, the women and children mean while expoſed to hazard, but by the
goodneſs of God made a ſafe eſcape to the other fortified houſe without
any harm, leaving their ſubſtance to the enemy, who made a prey of it, and
ſpent the reſidue of the day in removing the corn and houſhold-ſtuff
(in which loſs five Familyes were impoveriſhed) and firing upon the other
Gariſon: here alſo they took ſome Cattle. No ſooner was the ſignal
given by the firſt volley of ſhot, but immediately in ſeveral parts of
the town at once, did the ſmoakes ariſe, they firing the houſes.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon they uſed a ſtratagem not unlike the other,
to have ſurpriſed the ſingle Gariſon, but God prevented. An old
<hi>Indian</hi> if an <hi>Indian</hi> paſſed along the ſtreet with a
black ſheep on his back, with a ſlow pace, as one decrepit: They made
ſeveral ſhot at him, but miſſed him, at which ſeveral iſſued out
to have taken him alive, but the Watchman ſeaſonably eſpying an ambuſh
behind the houſe, gave the ſignal, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were prevented.</p>
            <p>The night following the enemy lodged in the town, ſome of them
in the Gariſon they had ſurprized, but the Body of them in an adjacent
valley, where they made themſelves merry after their ſavage manner. The
next morning they gave two or three Volleyes at Capt. <hi>Parkers</hi> 
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:171788:47"/> Gariſon, &amp; ſo marched off, fearing as was thought
that ſupply might be nigh at hand. This aſſault of theirs was managed
with their wonted ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlety and barbarous cruelty: for they ſtript the body
of him whom they had ſlain in the firſt onſet, and then cutting off his
head, fixed it upon a pole looking towards his own land. The corpſe of the
man ſlain the week before, they dug up out of his grave, they cut off his
head and one leg, and ſet them upon poles, and ſtript off his winding
ſheet. An Infant which they found dead in the houſe firſt ſurpriſed,
they cut in pieces, which afterward they caſt to the ſwine. There were
about forty dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling houſes burnt at that time, beſides other buildings.
This deſolation was followed with the breaking up of the town, and
ſcattering of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and removal of the Candleſtick, after it
had been there ſeated above twelve years.</p>
            <p>Concerning the ſurprizing of <hi>Groton, March</hi> 13. There
was not any thing much more material, then what is already mentioned, ſave
only the inſolency of <hi>John Monoco</hi> or <hi>one eyed John,</hi> the
chief Captain of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians in that deſign; who having by a ſudden
ſurprizal early in the morning ſeized upon a Gariſon houſe in one end
of the Town, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it, plundering what was there ready at hand, all
that day; and at night did very familiarly in appearance, call out to Capt.
<hi>Parker</hi> that was lodged in another Gariſon houſe, and entertained a
great deal of Diſcourſe with him, whom he called his <hi>old
Neighbour:</hi> dilating upon the cauſe of the War, and putting an end to it
by a friendly peace: yet oft mixing bitter Sarcaſmes, with ſeveral
blaſphemous ſcoffs and taunts at their praying and worſhipping God in the
meeting houſe, which he deridingly ſaid he had burned. Among other things
which he boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly uttered that night: he ſaid he burnt <hi>Medfield</hi>
(though it be not known whither he was there perſonally preſent or no)
<hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and that now he would burn that Town of <hi>Groton,</hi>
and the next time he would burn <hi>Chelmsford, Concord, Watertown, Cambridge,
Charlstown, Roxbury, Boſton,</hi> adding at laſt in their Dialect, <hi>What
Me will, Me do:</hi> not much unlike the proud <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> (if his
power had been equal to his pride) ſometime threatned againſt
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but was by the remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able providence of God, ſo
confounded within a few months after, that he was bereft of his four hundred
and fourſcore (of which he now boaſted) and only with a few more
Bragadozio's like himſelf, <hi>Sagamore Sam, old Jethro,</hi> and the
<hi>Sagamore</hi> of <hi>Quobaog</hi> were taken by the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, and was
ſeen (not long before the writing of this) marching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Gallows
(through <hi>Boſton</hi> Streets, which he threatned to burn at his
pleaſure) with an Halter about his neck, with which he was hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:171788:48"/> at the Towns end, <hi>September</hi> 26. in this preſent
year 1676. <hi>So let thine Enemies periſh O Lord,</hi> and ſuch contempt
be poured on all them that open their mouthes to blaſpheme thy holy Name.</p>
            <p>Things looked with a pritty ſad face about thoſe parts at this
time; yet <hi>though the Righteous fall ſeven times, let not their Enemies
rejoyce, for the Righteous ſhall riſe again, but their wicked Enemies
ſhall fall into miſchief, and riſe no more.</hi> It was ebbing water with
<hi>New-England</hi> at this time, and a while after; but God ſhall turn the
ſtream before it be long, and bring down their Enemies to lick the duſt
before them.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>April</hi> 17. Captain <hi>Sill,</hi> being
appointed to keep Gariſon at <hi>Groton,</hi> ſome Indians coming to hunt
for Swine, three Indians drew near the Gariſon houſe, ſuppoſing it to
have been deſerted, were two of them ſlain by one ſingle ſhot made by
the Captains own hands, and the third by another ſhot made from the
Gariſon.</p>
            <p>The danger which theſe inland Towns were like to be expoſed
unto from the Enemy, after they were driven out of the <hi>Narrhaganſet
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> was foreſeen by the Council of the
<hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> yea they had ſome intimation thereof from the
Enemy themſelves: but they were not well able to prevent it, in that
unſeaſonable time of the year; no way fit for marching of Souldiers, and
tranſporting of Proviſions (the Winter then beginning to break up in this
Country) for while our Forces were up in the <hi>Narrhaganſet Country,</hi>
in the Winter, a couple of Chriſtian In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians were ſent as Spyes into the
<hi>Nipnet</hi> and <hi>Narrhaganſet Country,</hi> through the Woods in the
depth of Winter, when the wayes were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſable for any other ſort of
people: theſe two, by name <hi>James</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> ordered their
buſineſs ſo prudently, as that they were admitted into thoſe Indian
habitations, as Friends, and had free liberty of Diſcourſe with them; they
were at the firſt a little jealous of them, but by the means of <hi>one eyed
John</hi> (a great Captain of the Indians, that afterward led them that
ſpoiled <hi>Groton,</hi> who having been a Companion of one of the ſaid
Spyes both in Hunting and in fighting againſt the <hi>Mohawks</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly;
ſo eſteemed of him, that he would not ſuffer any of the reſt to touch
him) they paſſed through all the Indian Towns lying thirty miles diſtant
from <hi>Quobaog,</hi> and twenty miles northward of the Road to
<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut:</hi> one of the ſaid Spyes returned about <hi>Jan.</hi> 24.
informing thoſe that ſent him, what he had obſerved, both the number of
the Indians (about three hundred in all) alſo their ſeveral Towns, and what
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion they had: plenty of Veniſon, much Pork from the Engliſh mens
Hogs which they had taken, they confeſſed likewiſe that he and ſome of
his party had killed the People at <hi>Naſhaway</hi> the laſt year,
ſuſpected to <pb n="77" facs="tcp:171788:48"/> have been done by the <hi>Indians</hi> of
<hi>Malberough:</hi> he told them alſo they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to burn
<hi>Lancaſter</hi> within three weeks after that time, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
they did much about the ſame time: adding moreover that ſome
<hi>Frenchmen</hi> were with them at <hi>Pocomptuck,</hi> encouraging of them
to go on with their deſigns, promiſing them aſſiſtance, which made
ſome ready to think the Indians were ſtirred up by the <hi>French</hi> to
do all this miſchief, but more of that afterwards: what might be gathered
from the foreſaid premiſes is eaſie to conceive; whereupon new Forces
with as much ſpeed as the ſeaſon would allow were raiſed and ſent up
into thoſe parts, under the command of Major <hi>Savage</hi> in chief: they
were diſpatched away in the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> and appointed to
meet with ſuch as ſhould be ſent from <hi>Connecticut Colony,</hi> which
they did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Quabaog,</hi> and ſo intended to march directly up to
thoſe Indian Towns about <hi>Watchuſet Hill</hi> to the Northweſt: but
the Indians were gone, and our Forces in the purſuit of them, taking the
wrong path miſſed of them, yet ranging through thoſe woods, they were at
one time ſudenly aſſaulted by a ſmall party of Indians firing upon
them, wounding Mr. <hi>Gerſhom Bulkly,</hi> by a ſhot in his Thigh, and
killing one of their Souldiers, after which as they marched along, they
accidentally fell upon another ſmall party of the Enemy, of whom they ſlew
ſome, and took others, to the number of ſixteen, yet could not meet with
the main Body of the Enemy who it ſeems had paſſed over a great River by
Rafts, ſo our men could follow them no further, wherefore turning down
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Hadly</hi> and <hi>North-hampton,</hi> whether it was ſuppoſed
the Indians intended to paſs, They came very ſeaſonably to the relief of
the ſaid Towns, which elſe had been in danger of being loſt. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 14. The Enemy fell upon <hi>North-Hampton,</hi> and
in three places broke through the Fortification of Palizadoes, ſet up round
about the Town a little before, for their better ſecurity: but the Town being
at that time full of Souldiers, they were quickly repulſed, after they had
killed four men, and two women, and fired four or five dwelling houſes, and
as many barns, with the loſs of many of their lives as was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
            <p>While our Forces under Major <hi>Savage</hi> continued on that
ſide of the Country, a ſad accident fell out at <hi>Springfield,</hi> the
certainty of which, it is judged meet here to relate, to prevent miſtakes:
the matter having through a great overſight been otherwiſe repreſented,
then indeed it was, not only to the prejudice of Truth, but to the
diſadvantage of ſome perſons concerned therein. While the Souldiers were
quartered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the ſeveral Towns upon <hi>Cinnecticut River;</hi> a
party of the Troop <pb n="78" facs="tcp:171788:49"/> were quartered at a place belonging to
<hi>Springfield</hi> called the <hi>Long Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,</hi> three miles from the
Town below toward <hi>Windſor:</hi> ſeveral of the Inhabitants having
moſt of the Winter kept from the publick meeting on the Lords dayes, for fear
of the Enemy, were incouraged to adventure to the Aſſembly, on the 26 of
<hi>March,</hi> riding in the company of the Troopers; but having heard of no
Indians thereabouts a good while, were more ſecure then they had cauſe; for
riding ſome of them with women behind them, and ſome with their Children in
their Arms yet not ſo careful as to keep in the middle, but rather in the
Rear, and at a pretty diſtance ſtragling from the reſt of the Company, a
party of Indians ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Buſhes as they rode along, fired upon the
hindmoſt, and killed two and wounded others: thoſe in the Front having
alſo Women and Maids behind ſome of them, were at a ſtand to know what to
do, fearing they might expoſe thoſe Women they had in their company, if
they ſhould ride back (in that winding Road made through a woody place for a
mile or two together) to look after them that were behind, at the laſt one
that came riding up, told the foremoſt company there was no hurt, and that
they were all coming: they that were before rode away with all ſpeed to the
end of the Town, where ſetting down the Women, the Troopers returned back,
but too late to recover too poor Women &amp; two children, who upon the firſt
aſſault were thrown off their horſes, and immediately haled into the
Buſhes, and through a ſwamp on the other ſide of a ſteep Bark, ſo as
they could not be heard of all that afternoon, nor the next day, till toward
night, although they were diligently ſearched after by all the Troopers in
and about the Town; At laſt when they were diſcryed juſt by a Swamp
ſide, the cruel wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es endeavoured to have killed them all, but in haſte
only wounded them with their hatchets, yet ſo as one of the poor creatures
recovered; the other with the children dyed of their wounds before they were
brought home, or within a little time after. They did not complain of any
inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility toward them while they were in their power; but by the Farewell
given them at their parting , they found it true by their own experience, that
<hi>the tender mercyes of the wicked are cruelty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There hapned no other matter of moment worthy the reporting, while
our Forces tarryed in thoſe parts, and the Commanders obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the
enemy was turned back again through the Woods, towards the
<hi>Maſſachuſets Bay,</hi> after a months time retired back, yet could
never meet with the enemy in their return through the Woods, although while
they were at the towns aforeſaid, they underſtood of ſeveral at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
made upon <hi>Sudbury, Marlberough,</hi> the moſt part of which laſt 
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:171788:49"/> they deſtroyed <hi>March</hi> 26. which made the
Inhabitants forſake their Dwellings, leaving only a few houſes gariſoned
with Souldiers, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſecure a paſſage to the towns weſtward
upon <hi>Connecticut River.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Sudbury,</hi> with the ſouldiers under
Leiut. <hi>Jacobs</hi> of <hi>Marlberough</hi> ſufficiently alarmed by the
late miſchief done about thoſe Towns, reſolved to try what work they
could make with the enemy in the night, whereupon going forth <hi>March</hi>
27. toward morning, they diſcerned where the enemy lay by their fires, (near
three hundred of them) and that within half a mile of a gariſon houſe, near
the place where they had done ſo much miſchief the day before. Such was the
courage and reſolution of the Engliſh, though but forty in number,
Towns-men and Souldiers, that they adventured to diſcharge upon them as they
lay by their fires, when it was ſo dark that an <hi>Indian</hi> could hardly
be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned from a better man, yet God ſo directing, they diſcharged
ſeveral times upon them, wounded thirty, fourteen of whom either dyed of
their wounds the ſame day or ſoon after, which had been chief agents in
this preſent miſchief againſt the Engliſh. Such was the ſucceſs of
this skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh that the Aſſailants came off without the loſs of one
man.</p>
            <p>After this time the enemy began to ſcatter about in ſmall
partyes, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what miſchief they could about the
<hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> killing a man at <hi>Weymouth,</hi> another at
<hi>Hingham,</hi> as they lay skulking up and down in Swamps and holes, to
aſſault any that occaſionally looked never ſo little into the woods,
ſometimes alarming the towns about <hi>Boſton</hi> by diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gunns
upon particular perſons; at <hi>Billerica, Braintree,</hi> and at
<hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham,</hi> near about which place in the Road to <hi>Rehoboth,</hi>
they aſſaulted one <hi>Woodcocks</hi> houſe, killed one man, and one of
his ſons, wounded another, and burned his ſons houſe.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the little ſucceſs of former attempts,
<hi>Philip</hi> and his men have one prize more to play in the
<hi>Maſſachuſets Colony,</hi> before they goe off the ſtage, and then
we ſhall ſoon ſee their power viſibly decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning every where, untill
their final overthrow come upon them. There were ſeveral ſmall Partyes of
them ſcattered up and down all over the Country, yet the main Body of them
was ſtill lurking up and down in thoſe woods that lye between
<hi>Brookefield, Marlburrough</hi> and <hi>Connecticut River.</hi> Poſſibly
they had ſome hope of driving all the Country before them to the towns upon
the ſea-coaſt; for having burned the deſerted houſes at
<hi>Marlburrough, April,</hi> 17. the next day they ſet upon <hi>Sudbury</hi>
with all their might, (hoping tis like) to doe there, as they had done at the
Towns next beyond it. They did at the firſt prevail ſo far as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
ſeveral houſes, and barns, and kill ſeveral perſons, ten or twelve of 
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:171788:50"/> the Engliſh, that came from <hi>Concord</hi> to
aſſiſt their neighbours at <hi>Sudbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> a town diſtant five miles
from them, at the firſt hearing of the alarm; who unawares were ſurpriſed
near a Gariſon houſe, in hope of getting ſome advantage upon a ſmall
Party of the enemy that preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a Meadow; a great number
of <hi>Indians</hi> that lay unſeen in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, ſuddenly roſe up,
and intercepting the paſſage to the Gariſon houſe, killed and took them
all.</p>
            <p>But our ſorrows and loſſes that day are not yet come to
their height; for in the after part of the ſame day, that reſolute
ſtout-hearted Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, Capt. <hi>Wadsworth</hi> (who had not long before,
with not above forty men, reſcued <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> when it was in danger
to have been all loſt at once) being ſent from <hi>Boſton</hi> with fifty
Souldiers to relieve <hi>Marlbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi> having m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rched five and twenty miles, and then underſtanding
the Enemy was gone through the Woods toward <hi>Sudbury:</hi> this unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Company, before ever they had taken any conſiderable reſt, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
immedietely back toward <hi>Sudbury</hi> (that lies ten miles nearer
<hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi>) and being come within a mile of the Town, they eſpyed a
party of Indians not far from them, about an hundred, not more, as they
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, theſe they might eaſily deal with; who retiring back a while,
drew Capt. <hi>Wadsworth</hi> and his Company above a mile into the Woods, when
on the ſudden a great body of the Enemy appeared, about five hundred as was
thought, who compaſſing them in round, forced them to the top of an hill,
where they made very ſtout reſiſtance a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble while; but the
night drawing on, and ſome of the Company begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to ſcatter from the
reſt, their fellows were forced to follow them, ſo as the Enemy taking the
chaſe, purſued them on every ſide, as they made too haſty a retreat, by
which accident, being ſo much overpowred by the Enemies numbers, they were
moſt of them loſt: the Captain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, with one Captain
<hi>Brocklebank</hi> (a choice ſpirited man, much lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Town of
<hi>Rowly</hi> to which he belonged) and ſome others that fell into his
Company as he marched along, ſcarce twenty eſcaping in all; ſo as another
Captain and his fifty periſhed at that time, of as brave Souldiers as any
were ever imployed in the preſent ſervice.</p>
            <p>Thus as in former attempts of like nature; too much courage and
eagerneſs in purſuit of the Enemy, hath added another fatal blow to this
poor Country.</p>
            <p>The ſame day another party of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> coming from
<hi>Brookefield,</hi> whithey they were ſent as a Convoy with Proviſion for
the Gariſon, were in danger likewiſe of falling into the hands of the
ſame Indians, yet riding upon a good ſpeed, and keeping their Guns always
ready pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented <pb n="81" facs="tcp:171788:50"/> againſt them they met, they never
durſt fire at them: only three or four having unadviſedly firſt
diſcharged their gunns againſt the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and falling too much in the reer
of their Company, were cut off and loſt. It is reported by ſome that
afterwards eſcaped, how they cruelly tortured five or ſix of the Engliſh
that night: yet whatever their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs was this day, it was obſerved by
ſome (at that time their Priſoners, and ſince releaſed) that they
ſeemed very penſive after they came to their Quarters, ſhewing no ſuch
ſigns of rejoycing, as they uſually were wont to doe in like caſe;
whither for the loſs of ſome of their own Company in that dayes
enterpriſe, (ſaid to be an hundred and twenty) or whither it were the Devil
in whom they truſted, and to whom they made their addreſs the day before,
by ſundry Conjurations of their <hi>Powawes?</hi> or whither it were by any
dread that the Almighty ſent upon their ſpirits, upon their execrable
Blaſphemies, which tis ſaid they uſed in the tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of ſome of
their poor Captives (bidding Jeſus come and deliver them out of their hands
from death if he could) we leave as uncertain, though ſome have ſo
reported, yet ſure it is that after this day, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver proſpered in any
attempt they made againſt the Engliſh, but were continually ſcattered and
broken, till they were in a manner all conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. After this time, however
they had braved it before, they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to apprehend that it was ſcarce
feaſible for them to withſtand the power of the Engliſh, and therefore
ſeemed more inclinable to a peace, by ſeveral overtures made by them, if
they knew how to have brought it about. For during theſe encounters they were
willing to admit of ſome kind of treaty with the Engliſh, about the
releaſing of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of their Captives, which they took at
<hi>Lancaſter</hi> in <hi>February</hi> laſt, and elſewhere: To that end
ſundry attempts were made by help of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the <hi>Praying
Indians</hi> (as they uſe to be called) about the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome of
the women and children, which were at time in their poſſeſſion, &amp;
by degrees ſomething was effected that way: poſſibly their own preſent
ſufferings and wants that were upon them, might induce them thereunto: For by
this time the Spring of the year came on, their proviſion was all ſpent,
and they forced to live wholly upon ground-nuts, and upon the fleſh of the
Engliſh creatures, both horſe &amp; neat cattle, which they daily
plundered. The Ground-nuts running up to ſeed in the ſummer, began to grow
ſo ſticky, as they were ſcarce eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; the fleſh alſo of the
Engliſh cattle proving unwholſome for their Bodyes, filling them with
ſundry diſeaſes. One of them having eaten much horſe-fleſh,
complained that he had before eaten horſe, and now horſe began to eat him,
meaning ſome deadly diſeaſe growing upon his <pb n="82" facs="tcp:171788:51"/> eating
ſuch ranke fleſh, unwholſome for their Bodyes, eſpecially without
ſalt, as their uſual manner is. The fiſhing ſeaſon alſo began now
to come in, wherein they uſe to take abundance of all ſorts, with which
thoſe great Rivers up the Country are abundantly ſtored: they uſe to take
thereof, and drying it in the ſmoak, make proviſion thereof for the
greateſt part of the year; and if the warr continued, they could not but
ſee they ſhould utterly be cut off therefrom, and that if the planting
ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alſo were loſt, they ſhould be in great want of ſummer
fruits, <hi>ſc.</hi> beans and ſquaſhes (beſides their corn) with which
they were wont to live all the latter part of the ſummer. Upon all
conſiderations, they ſeemed pretty inclinable to hearken to a peace, though
ſome were apt to think they would never have kept it, further then would
ſtand with their own advantage, and that their preſent deſire thereof was
only to gain time.</p>
            <p>A perſon formerly acquainted with the <hi>Indians</hi> about
<hi>Lancaſter,</hi> did adventure upon the forementioned overtures, to goe
amongſt them to try if he could not prevail with them for the redemption of
the Miniſters wife, taken Captive in <hi>Febraury</hi> laſt from
<hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and through the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of him who having the hearts of
all in his hand, inclines them as he pleaſes, obtained the deſired end upon
an inconſiderable ſum, which gave encouragement to the Councell to ſend
two Meſſengers on the like er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand the ſame week, to procure the
redemption of others, not without ſucceſs: The former, <hi>viz.</hi> Mrs.
<hi>Rowlandſon</hi> being brought to <hi>Boſton</hi> upon the Election day,
<hi>May,</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi> it was generally looked at as a ſmile of
providence, and doubtleſs was a return of prayer, and anſwer of faith, with
which her husband had been upheld, and ſupported from the day of her
Captivity; his two children alſo were returned back not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, more by
the over-ruling hand of God (<hi>that turns the Captivity of his people as the
ſtreames of the South;</hi> and ſometimes inclining them to pitty his
Servants, that are of themſelves more cruell then the Sea-monſters) then by
any other contrivance of mans policy,</p>
            <p>And yet notwithſtanding motions of this nature about the
redemption of ſome of our Priſoners ſtill in their hands, there was no
ceſſation of armes between us.</p>
            <p>About this time Letters were ſent down from <hi>Connecticut
Colony,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the General Court then aſſembled at
<hi>Boſton,</hi> that ſome of the <hi>Mohawkes</hi> (a ſort of fierce and
ſavage <hi>Indians,</hi> yet mortal enemyes to theſe we were at warrs
withall) had fallen upon ſome of <hi>Philips.</hi> Party, and deſtroyed
many of them: likewiſe that many of them were deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Feavers and
Fluxes, with other diſtempers falling amongſt them, <pb n="83" facs="tcp:171788:51"/>
which was ſome reviving to our hopes, that the foot of our enemy ſhould
ſlide in due time, and that deſtruction was haſtning upon them, though
ſtill they were permitted to do miſchief in ſundry particular pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of
the Country, which muſt be minded as we paſs along.</p>
            <p>Thoſe Indians that were our profeſſed enemies, after they
had been beaten out of the <hi>Narrhaganſet Country, Febr.</hi> 1. tarried
awhile at <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imazeag,</hi> a place two days journey north of
<hi>Quabaog,</hi> where they divided themſelves into two Companies, one of
them tarried on that ſide the Country, the other made toward <hi>Plimouth
Colony,</hi> taking <hi>Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> in their way, from whence as they
marched along they met with a notable repulſe at <hi>Boggiſton,</hi> a
ſmall Hamlet, or Company of Farms not far from the ſaid <hi>Medfield</hi>
where they attempted a Garriſon, but meeting with ſtout reſiſtance,
they left the enterprize; and kept on their way toward <hi>Plimouth</hi>
Colony, where they ſcattered themſelves up and down, waiting for
opportunityes to ſpoil and deſtroy the Engliſh Plantations on that ſide
of the Country.</p>
            <p>Beſides what is already mentioned, on <hi>May,</hi> 11. a party
of them aſſaulted the town of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> burnt eleven houſes and
five barns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing thereunto: on the other ſide, a ſmall party of the
Engliſh ſcout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about in purſuit of the Indians, fell upon a Party of
them, that lay waiting in ambuſh; but being diſcerned by an Indian in the
Company of our men that gave timely notice, our ſouldiers had an opportuity
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make the firſt ſhot, and thereby not only prevented a
miſchief to themſelves, but killed alſo ſome of the enemy, (one of whom
was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to be of more note then his fellows by his attire) the reſt
fled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them that purſued, though but a ſmall company; ſo that
there were daily reciprocal acts of hoſtility in thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>Within a few dayes after this, ſeven houſes and two barns more
were burnt by the enemy, in and about <hi>Plimouth:</hi> who did the like
miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief about the ſame time to the remaining houſes of
<hi>Namasket</hi> or <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleborough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time, another ſort of Indians that belonged to
<hi>Wameſit</hi> a place near <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> bordering upon
<hi>Merrimack</hi> (who had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by the raſh, unadviſed, cruel
act of ſome of the Engliſh, about <hi>Octob.</hi> 27. and <hi>Novemb.</hi>
4. had fired upon them ſeveral gunns, both at <hi>Chelmsford</hi> and
<hi>Woburn,</hi> to the killing of ſome, and wounding of others upon
ſuſpition that the ſaid Indians were guilty of burning a Barn, and
Hay-ſtack not far off) ſuddenly turned our enemies, after the winter was
over; having firſt withdrawn themſelves from the place aſſigned them,
and where they had been relieved all the winter (ſome of them <pb facs="tcp:171788:52"/>
after a former revolt) and took their opportunity to fire Mr.
<hi>Falconers</hi> houſe in <hi>Andover</hi> town early that Spring, and
wounded one <hi>Roger Marks,</hi> and killed his horſe. Two more houſes
about <hi>Shawſhin</hi> beyond the ſaid <hi>Andover,</hi> were burned about
<hi>Mar.</hi> 10. Alſo they killed a young man of the ſaid town,
<hi>Apr.</hi> 8. the ſon of <hi>George Abbot;</hi> And another ſon of his
alſo was carried away the ſame day, who yet was returned ſome few moneths
after, almoſt pined to death with hunger.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time they killed ſome of their Cattle, cutting out
only the tongues of ſome of them for haſte, being ſhot at by ſeveral of
the Inhabitants from their Garriſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. At <hi>Concord</hi> two men going for Hay one of
them was killed.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Wameſit Indians,</hi>
about <hi>March</hi> 18 before, fel upon ſome houſes on the north ſide of
the River; burnt down three or four that belonged to the Family of <hi>Edward
Colburn:</hi> the ſaid <hi>Colburn,</hi> with <hi>Samuel Varnham</hi> his
neighbour, being purſued, as they paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the River to look after
their Cattle on that ſide of the river; and making ſeveral ſhots
againſt them, who returned the like again upon the ſaid Indians, (judged to
be about forty) what ſucceſs they had upon the enemy, was beſt known to
themſelves; but two of <hi>Varnhams</hi> ſons were ſlain by the enemyes
ſhot before they could recover the other ſide of the River. <hi>Apr.</hi>
15. alſo were 14. or 15. houſes burnt there.</p>
            <p>Not long before this, <hi>Febr.</hi> 1. 1675. <hi>Tho. Eames</hi>
that kept a Farm at <hi>Sudbury,</hi> whoſe dwelling was three or four miles
out of the town, had his houſe aſſaulted and fired, his wife killed, and
his children carried Captive among the Indians.</p>
            <p>Alſo two men were killed at a Farm about <hi>Concord,
Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob Shepard</hi> by name, about the middle of
<hi>February,</hi> and a young maid that was ſet to watch upon an hill, of
about 15. years of age, was carried Captive; who ſtrangly eſcaped away upon
an horſe that the Indians had taken from <hi>Lancaſter</hi> a little
before. In the like ſtrange manner did one of <hi>Eames</hi> his children
eſcape away about <hi>May</hi> 3. laſt; travelling thirty miles alone in
the woods, without any relief till he came to an Engliſh town. <hi>Eames</hi>
his houſe was aſſaulted when himſelf was from home, by an
<hi>Indian</hi> called <hi>Netus</hi> (not long after ſlain at
<hi>Malborough</hi>) which had been very familiar with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
with nine or ten more of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, as perfidious and barbarous as
himſelf: They burned all the dwellings that belonged to the Farm, Corn, Hay
and Cattle, beſides the dwelling houſe with what was therein; it is
probable thoſe at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi> were killed by the ſame hands about a
fortnight after.</p>
            <p>Many ſuch like remarkable inſtances of ſpecial providences
might <pb n="84" facs="tcp:171788:52"/> be mentioned, if it were convenient to inſert
ſuch particular paſſages into the general Narrative of the late troubles
from our barbarous enemies.</p>
            <p>On <hi>May</hi> 3. a party of them killed a man at
<hi>Haverhill,</hi> upon the edge of <hi>Merrimack River;</hi> and paſſing
over the ſaid River to <hi>Bradford,</hi> ſpoiled another Family; killing
one <hi>Thomas Kemball,</hi> and carrying his wife and five Children captive,
forty miles up into the woods; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it was queſtioned whether this
laſt miſchief were done by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Philips</hi> party, but rather by
ſome that belonged to the Eaſtward <hi>Indians,</hi> of which there may be
occaſion (God willing) to ſpeak more afterward.</p>
            <p>For the ſuppreſſing of theſe inſolencies, ſeveral
Companies of freſh ſouldiers, both horſe and Foot were raiſed in the
<hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> by the Governour and Council of that Colony, and
ſent out to ſuppreſs the common enemy; the Foot under the command of
Capt. <hi>Sill,</hi> Capt. <hi>Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> Capt. <hi>Holbrook,</hi> the
Horſe under the Command of Capt. <hi>Brattle,</hi> Capt. <hi>Prentice,</hi>
Capt. <hi>Henchman,</hi> Commander in chief: theſe ſeveral Companies
modelled as aforeſaid, were ſent out <hi>Apr.</hi> 27. 1676. to range the
woods towards <hi>Haſſanameſit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the 6. of <hi>May,</hi> they met with a conſiderable party
of the enemy: they were firſt diſcovered by the <hi>Natick</hi> ſcouts
purſuing a Bear &amp; at the firſt not diſcerning that the
<hi>Natick</hi> Indian ſcouts belonged to our men, it gave ſome advantage
to our forces; our Horſemen falling upon them before they were well aware,
killed and took of the Enemy about ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, which they took notice of at the
preſent, although it was confeſſed by the enemy, that they loſt twenty
that encounter. It was report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the ſounding of a trumpet without
order, did much hurt, but the Commander in chief affirmeth, that it was no
diſadvantage to the ſervice in hand, it neither being heard by our own
Foot, nor yet by the enemy. If any error was committed by the Engliſh
Companies, it was in that the Horſe did not timely enough draw down from the
top of the hill, whereby they came to be diſcovered by the enemy; who
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon made the more haſte to eſcape: However it was no ſmall loſs
to the enemy, ſome of the ſlain being known to be conſiderable
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and it ſtruck ſuch a terror into them, that they never durſt
face our men afterwards; for although after our men returned to their Quarters
at <hi>Medfield,</hi> they ſaw two hundred fires in the night, yet they could
never come near them again to fight any company of them: but the ſeaſon
proving rainy, hindred any further purſuit of them at that time. And ſoon
after this the ſouldiers being <pb facs="tcp:171788:53"/> viſited with ſickly
diſtempers by reaſon of an Epidemical Cold at that time prevailing through
the Country, they were for the preſent releaſed for the recovery of their
health, with intent to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together again at a more convenient time;
this was done <hi>May</hi> the tenth.</p>
            <p>During this interval of time, upon a report that a party of the
Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that were diſcovered about <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> buſie in fiſhing in
a River thereabouts, Capt. <hi>Brattle</hi> was ſent up about the 23d. of
<hi>May,</hi> who with the help of ſome of the Inhabitants, killed eleven or
twelve of them without the loſs but of one of our men: Had they not
diſcovered ſome of ours on the oppoſite ſhoar, it was conceived a
greater ſpoile might have been made amongſt them.</p>
            <p>But in the next place we muſt take notice of the proceedings of
the enemy about <hi>Connecticut:</hi> The greateſt Body of them made towards
<hi>Plimouth Colony</hi> early in the Spring as was ſaid before, where we
ſhall leave them for the preſent, and obſerve what the remaining part of
them did weſtward.</p>
            <p>Some ſcattering partyes were skulking about
<hi>Springfield,</hi> and thoſe lower towns, upon a ſmall numbe of whom
Capt. <hi>Holioke</hi> (newly cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Captain or <hi>Springfield</hi> in the
room of his father lately deceaſed) hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled his office, early in the
Spring: for having notice of ſome of them in thoſe woods, he marched after
them with ten or twelve reſolute young men, and waiting his opportunity,
ſurprized them near the great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſo as two or three of them were left
dead upon the place, another mortally wounded, got on to an Iſland in the
river, where it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded be took his laſt nights lodging The other
being ſorely wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was taken alive, and brought home to
<hi>Springfield,</hi> where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed many things to one of the
Inhabitants that underſtood their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, owning the truth in many things
againſt his own company, and ſoon after dyed of his wounds.</p>
            <p>This was but a Preparative to an higher piece of ſervice, which
Capt. <hi>Holioke</hi> was ſoon after engaged in and wherein he acquitted
himſelf beyond expectation; and taking more pains then ordinary, in making
his retreat, he gat a Surfet, that ended his dayes in <hi>September</hi>
follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about <hi>Boſton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the beginning of <hi>April</hi> likewiſe ſome of the
Inhabitants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Hadly,</hi> attending their tillage at
<hi>Hockanum,</hi> within three miles of the town, and having a guard of
ſouldiers with them, yet three of the company were caſually ſlain by a
party of the enemy, that lay in wait for ſuch an opportunity. One of them was
Mr. <hi>Goodman,</hi> a dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con <pb n="85" facs="tcp:171788:53"/> of the <hi>Church,</hi>
that went a little beyond the Command of the Souldiers that came to guard them,
to view the fence of his own land: and two others that contrary to expreſs
order, would venture upon the top of an high hill, neer by, to take a
needleſs and unſeaſonable view of the Country, were ſhot down by the
enemy before they could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their <hi>Corps du gard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the great Company of the enemy, that ſtayed on that ſide
of the Country, and about <hi>Watchuſet Hills,</hi> when the reſt went
towards <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> though they had been diſappointed in their
planting, by the death of <hi>Canonchet,</hi> were loth to looſe the
advantage of the fiſhing ſeaſon then coming in; wherefore having ſeated
themſelves near the upper Falls of <hi>Connecticut River,</hi> not far from
<hi>Deerfield,</hi> and perceiving that the Engliſh Forces were now drawn off
from the lower towns of <hi>Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>Northampton,</hi> now and then
took advantages to plunder them of their Cattle, and not fearing any
aſſault from our Souldiers, grew a little ſecure, while they were upon
their Fiſhing deſign, inſomuch that a couple of Engliſh lads lately
taken captive by the enemy, and making their eſcape, acquainted their friends
at home how ſecure they lay in thoſe places, which ſo animated the
Inhabitants of <hi>Hadly, Hatfield</hi> and <hi>Northampton,</hi> that they
being willing to be revenged for the loſs of their cattle, beſides other
preceding miſchiefs, took up a reſolution with what ſtrength they could
raiſe among themſelves (partly out of gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſouldiers, and partly of
the Inhabitants) to make an aſſault upon them, which if it had been done
with a little more deliberation, waiting for the coming of ſupplyes expected
from <hi>Hartford,</hi> might have proved a fatal buſineſs to all the
ſaid Indians: yet was the victory obtained more conſiderable then at
firſt was apprehended. For not having much above an hundred and fifty
fighting men in their Company, they marched ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently in the dead of the
night, <hi>May</hi> 18. and came upon the ſaid Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans a little before break
of day, whom they found almoſt in a dead ſleep, without any Scouts abroad,
or watching about their wigwams at home; for in the evening they had made
themſelves merry with new milk and roſt beef, having lately driven away
many of their milch cows, as an Engliſh woman confeſſed, that was made to
milk them.</p>
            <p>When they came near the Indians rendezvouze, they allighted off
their horſes, and tyed them to ſome young trees at a quarter of a miles
diſtance, ſo marching up, they fired amain into their very wigwams, killing
many upon the place, and frighting others with the ſudden a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm of their
Gunns, made them run into the River, where the ſwiftneſs of the ſtream
carrying them down a ſteep Fall, they periſhed in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <pb facs="tcp:171788:54"/> ſome getting into Canooes, (ſmall boats made of the barks of
Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen trees) which proved to them a <hi>Charons</hi> boat, being ſunk, or
over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, by the ſhooting of our men, delivered them into the like danger
of the waters, giving them thereby a paſport into the other world: others of
them creeping for ſhelter under the banks of the great river, were eſpyed
by our men and killed with their ſwords; Capt. <hi>Holioke</hi> killing five,
young and old, with his own hands from under a bank. When the Indians were
firſt awakened with the thunder of their gunns, they cried out <hi>Mohawks,
Mohawks,</hi> as if their own native enemies had been upon them: but the
dawning of the light, ſoon notified their error, though it could not prevent
the danger.</p>
            <p>Such as came back ſpake ſparingly of the number of the
ſlain, ſome ſay there could not in reaſon be leſs then two or three
hundred of them that muſt neceſſarily periſh in the midſt of ſo
many inſtruments of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction managed againſt them with ſuch
diſadvantages to themſelves. Some of their priſoners afterwards owned
that they loſt above three hundred in that Camizado, ſome whereof were
principal men Sachems, and ſome of their beſt fighting men that were left,
which made the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory more conſiderable then elſe it would have been; nor
did they ſeem ever to have recovered themſelves after this defeat, but
their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine immediately followed upon it. Yet ſuch was the awfull hand of
Providence, in the cloſe of this victory, mixing much bitter with the
ſweet, that it might well be called a coſtly victory to the Conquerors,
that ſo no fleſh ſhould glory in it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The Indians that lay ſcattering on both ſides of the river,
after they recovered themſelves, and diſcovered the ſmall number of them
that aſſailed them, turned head upon the Engliſh, who in their retreat
were a little diſordered, for want of the help of the eldeſt Captain, that
was ſo enfeebled by ſickneſs before he ſet out, that he was no way able
for want of bodily ſtrength (not any way defective for want of skill or
courage) to aſſiſt or direct in making the retreat: For ſome of the
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy fell upon the Guards that kept the horſes, others purſued them in
the reer, ſo as our men ſuſtained pretty much damage as they retired,
miſſing after their return thirty eight of their men: And if Capt.
<hi>Holioke</hi> had not played the man at a more then ordinary rate,
ſometimes in the Front, ſometimes in the flank and reer, at all times
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging the ſouldiers, it might have proved a fatal buſineſs to the
aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailants. The ſaid Capt. <hi>Holiokes</hi> horſe was ſhot down
under him, and himſelf ready to be aſſaulted by many of the Indians,
juſt coming upon him, but diſcharging his piſtolls upon one or two of
them, whom he <pb n="86" facs="tcp:171788:54"/> preſently diſpatched, and another friend
coming up to his reſcue, he was ſaved, and ſo carried off the ſouldiers
without any further loſs.</p>
            <p>It is confidently reported by ſome that were there preſent at
this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, that one told above an hundred Indians left dead upon the
place; and another affirmed that he told near an hundred and forty ſwimming
down the Falls, none of which were obſerved to get alive to ſhore, ſave
one.</p>
            <p>The loſs that befell our men in the retreat, was occaſioned
principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the bodily weakneſs of Capt. <hi>Turner,</hi> unable to
manage his charge any longer, yet ſome ſay they wanted powder, which forced
them to retire as faſt as they could by Capt. <hi>Turners</hi> order.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid alſo by one preſent at the fight, that ſeven or
eight in the reer of the Engliſh, through haſte miſſed their way, and
were never heard of again; and without doubt fell into the Indians hands, and
it is feared ſome of them were tortured.</p>
            <p>About ſeven dayes after this, they were minded to try the chance
of Warr again, and ſee if they could not recover their loſs, by returning
the like upon the Engliſh: For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 30. A great number of them appeared before
<hi>Hatfield,</hi> fired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twelve houſes and barns without the
Fortification of the town, driving away multitudes of their Cattle, and their
Sheep; ſpreading themſelves in the meadow near the town: which bravado ſo
raiſed the courage of their neighbours at <hi>Hadly,</hi> that twenty five
reſolute young men ventured over the river, to relieve <hi>Hatfield</hi> in
this diſtreſs, who charged the enemy with ſuch undaunted courage and
reſolution <hi>(Auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fortuna juvat)</hi> that they beat down five or
ſix at the firſt ſhot they made, ſo making way through the thickeſt
of their enemies, that lay ready to take aim at them behind every tree, as they
paſſed by; yet they eſcaped all their ſhot till they came within a
little of the town they came to relieve, where they loſt five of their twenty
five.</p>
            <p>The enemy being amazed at the reſolution of our men, being but
ſo ſmall an handfull, that they fled immediately from the town; having
loſt twenty five of their men in the enterprize.</p>
            <p>The Council of the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> gathering by
theſe proceedings of the Indians, that their deſire of peace was only to
gain time, Ordered that the forces raiſed before <hi>Apr.</hi> 27. and for a
time releaſed ſhould be haſtned out again to range the woods towards
<hi>Hadly,</hi> and thoſe parts; made an agreement with <hi>Hartford
Colony</hi> to ſend forces from thence to meet them about
<hi>Brookfield,</hi> &amp; ſo to ſcoure along on both ſides
<hi>Connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icut River,</hi> to diſreſt the enemy what they could, &amp;
keep them from fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thoſe waters, their hope of planting being now
almoſt over.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:171788:55"/>To this end about <hi>May</hi> 30. 1676. the Forces
under Capt. <hi>Henchman</hi> were called together again, and ſent to
<hi>Brookfiold</hi> to meet with thoſe expected from <hi>Hartford
Colony:</hi> In the way, ours by the direction of <hi>Tom. Doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi> (a
<hi>Natick Indian,</hi> who was a little before imployed in the redemption of
Captives) following tracks of Indians, came upon a party of the enemy fiſhing
in <hi>Weſhacom Ponds</hi> toward <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> of whom they killed
ſeven, &amp; took 29. moſt women and Children; yet belonging to
conſirerable Perſons, it made the ſucceſs the more to be valued. Our
Forces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by this means retarded, could not meet with thoſe of
<hi>Connecticut</hi> at <hi>Brookfield;</hi> but followed them the week after;
having firſt returned from <hi>Weſhacom</hi> to <hi>Malborough</hi> to
ſupply themſelves with ammunition; and ſo marched directly towards
<hi>Hadly,</hi> where they met with <hi>Connecticut For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> and from
thence accoding to mutual agreement, ours marched on the eaſt ſide of the
river, and <hi>Connecticut Forces</hi> on the Weſt, up toward
<hi>Squakheag,</hi> coming to <hi>Deerfield,</hi> &amp; the great Falls
thereabouts, they ſent up their Scouts, but not hearing of the enemy, they
marched up no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, being in no good capacity to have gone further if there
had been oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, by reaſon of a tedious Storm of rain, which
occaſioned much damage in their Amunition and Proviſion. While our Forces
lay about <hi>Deerfield,</hi> ſome of our ſouldiers ranging lighted upon
the Body of Capt. <hi>Turner,</hi> about <hi>Greens River,</hi> in paſſing
of which ſtream he was ſuppoſed to have received his mortal wounds.</p>
            <p>While our Forces continued thereabouts, they did the enemy ſome
lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſpoile in ſeizing much of their Fiſh, &amp; goods ſtolen from
the Engliſh, &amp; hid in their barns, under ground; conjecturing alſo that
they found 4. or 5. places where ſome of the Engliſh had been tortured to
death by cruel burning, after they had been faſtned between ſtakes ſet in
the ground: but not meeting with any of the enemy; they all haſted
home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, conceiving that having been forced from their quarters in thoſe
parts, they were drawn down lower, towards the Engliſh plantations,
eaſtward <hi>viz. Plimouth</hi> and the <hi>Maſſachuſets.</hi> What
ſucceſs C. <hi>Hench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s forces had in their retiring homeward, and
what they obſerved of the motion of the Indians, take in the words of his own
Letter <hi>June,</hi> 30. 
<floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                  <body>
                     <p>—Our Scouts brought intelligence, that all the Indians

for, for what with the falling ſhort of the Bread promiſed us, and a great

            <p>It appears plainly by the contents of the ſaid Letter, as well
as by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other teſtimonyes, that about this time the Indians our Enemyes,
who hitherto had been linked together as Brethren in iniquity, and cruelty,
were now ſtrangly divided and ſeperated the one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſome

This was reported by an Indian brought to <hi>Seaconk, June,</hi> 29. 1676.

ſome quarrel amongſt themſelves, occaſioned by an evill ſpirit ſent
from God upon them, that thereby they might, being ſcattered, the more
eaſily be taken and ruined by the Engliſh, now that the time of vengeance
was come, when they ſhall be called to an account for all their former
outrages and crueltyes; for now is the ſnare haſtning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, wherein
they ſhall be hampered in their own devices, ſo to be taken and
deſtroyed: it cannot but be acknowledged as a very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Providence,
that Capt. <hi>Henchman</hi> in his late expedition to <hi>Hadly,</hi> killed
and took about eighty four of the Enemy, without the loſs of any one of his
own men: the like favourable ſucceſs hapned to Major <pb n="88" facs="tcp:171788:56"/>
               <hi>Talcot,</hi> in his paſſage from <hi>Norwich</hi> to <hi>Quabaog,</hi>
as was ſaid before, and ſoon after his return.</p>
            <p>But by that time our Forces were returned home as far as
<hi>Sudbury;</hi> they were ordered upon the ſolicitation of the Governour of
<hi>Plimouth,</hi> two Companies of them at leaſt, to march away immediately

Plantations thereabouts, and whither alſo a little before, Capt.
<hi>Brattle</hi> with a Troop of Horſe, and Captain <hi>Moſely</hi> with a
Foot Company were ſent up from <hi>Boſton</hi> to purſue after them, now
flocking in great numbers into thoſe Woods; there was at this time no ſmall

was ſeen in this and that place, not with above twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or thirty men
attending on him: but his time was not yet fully come, nor had he as yet fully
accompliſhed all that miſchief, he was like to be ſuffered to do: For
upon <hi>July</hi> 1<hi>ſt.</hi> 1676. a party of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians committed an
horrid and barbarous Murder upon Mr. <hi>Hezekiah Willet</hi> in
<hi>Swanzy,</hi> an hopeful young Gentleman, as any in thoſe parts; they
uſed frequently to keep a Sentinel on the top of their Houſe, from a
Watch-houſe built thereon, whence they could diſcover any Indians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they came near the houſe, but not hearing of the Enemy in thoſe parts for a
conſiderable time, that neceſſary piece of circumſpection was omitted
that day, whereby that deſerving perſon was betrayed into their cruel
hands, for within a quarter of an hour after he went out of his own doors,
within ſight of his Houſe, he was ſhot at by three of them at once, from
every one of whom he received a mortal wound; they after their barbarous manner
took off his head; and carried it away with them (which yet was ſoon after
recovered) leaving the Trunk of his body behind, as a ſad monument of their
inhumane cruelty: the ſame Indians, not being above thirty in number, took
away a <hi>Negro</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſame Family, who being faithful to
his Maſters, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries intereſt, ventured his life to make his

<hi>conſiderable damage</hi> to the Engliſh in that part of the Country. So
as after this day we may truly date the time of <hi>our Deliverance,</hi> and

            <p>Our Friends and Brethren of that Colony, although they had never
actually felt <hi>half of thoſe miſeries,</hi> that befell the people of
the other two, yet never denyed <hi>their Aſſiſtance</hi> to the
ſuppreſſing of the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy,</hi> yea, ſometimes they did

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according to Agreement, the Councel of that Colony ordered their
ſucceſsful Commander <hi>Major Talcot</hi> to meet with our Forces at
<hi>Brook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> or <hi>Quabaog</hi> in order to the purſuing of the
Enemy in thoſe parts: In the way as they were from <hi>Norwich</hi> marching
thither, <hi>Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> ſo far ſmiled upon the Enterprize, as
to give them an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to ſurprize <hi>fifty one of the Enemy,</hi> of

            <p>It was accounted by ſome, that were preſent near the time of

publick Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to God, who had remembred his people thus in their low

elſe the people might have been <hi>cut off,</hi> had not that <hi>Accident
Intervened.</hi> It is certain, that after the end of this <hi>Month,</hi> the
power of <hi>the Enemy</hi> began every where to <hi>fail;</hi> for the
<hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Enemy,</hi> that had <hi>lurked</hi> about
<hi>Connecticut River</hi> all this Spring, being viſited with <hi>ſundry
diſeaſes,</hi> diſappointed of <hi>their fiſhing,</hi> and put by
<hi>their planting,</hi> began to fall at variance amongſt themſelves; the
<hi>Hadly</hi> and <hi>Pocumtuck Indians</hi> quarrelling with <hi>Philip</hi>
for fetching all this <hi>miſchief</hi> about, and occaſioning the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> and them to <hi>fall out,</hi> with whom they had alwayes
<hi>good Correſpondence,</hi> and lived <hi>lovingly</hi> 
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:171788:59"/> together, but now they were like to be ruined by the <hi>War.</hi>
This <hi>quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel</hi> proceeded to that <hi>height,</hi> that from that time
forward, thoſe ſeveral Indians that had for ſo long time been
<hi>combined together,</hi> reſolved now to part, and every one to
<hi>ſhift for themſelves,</hi> and return to their <hi>own homes:
Philip</hi> to <hi>Mount-hope,</hi> and the <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> to their
<hi>own</hi> Country again: the <hi>Nipnets</hi> and the <hi>River
Indians,</hi> bending their courſe ſome <hi>Westward,</hi> others
<hi>North-ward</hi> towards <hi>Pennicook</hi> upon <hi>Merrimack,</hi>
intending to <hi>ſhift for themſelves,</hi> as well as they could for the
future; all which is like to be the real and true ſtate of the Caſe with
the Indians which were our Enemies: for the next News we heard of
<hi>Philip,</hi> was that he was gotten back to <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> now like
to become <hi>Mount-Miſery</hi> unto him, and his <hi>Vagabond Crew,</hi> and
that his <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes,</hi> that had hitherto ſtood as
<hi>Neuters,</hi> waiting only which way the <hi>Scale</hi> of Succeſs and
Victory would turn, began now to ſue for mercy at the hands of the
<hi>Engliſh:</hi> The <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> Government having
underſtood ſomething of this nature, put forth a <hi>Declaration,</hi> that
what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Indians ſhould within <hi>fourteen dayes</hi> next enſuing
come in to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> might hope for <hi>mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongſt ſundry that came in, there was one named
<hi>James</hi> the <hi>Printer</hi> the <hi>Superadded Title</hi>
diſtinguiſhing him from others of that name: who being a <hi>notorious
Apostate,</hi> that had learned ſo much of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as not
only to read and write, but had attained likewiſe ſome skill in print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and might have attained more, (had he not like a <hi>falſe Villain</hi> ran
away from his <hi>Maſter</hi> before his time was out) he having ſeen and
read the ſaid <hi>Declaration</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> did venture
himſelf upon that Faith thereof, and came to ſue for his Life; he affirmed,
with others that came along with him, that more Indians had dyed ſince this
<hi>War</hi> began of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſes (ſuch as at other times they uſed not
to be acquainted withal) than by the Sword of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not long after many of them came and offered themſelves, to the
number of near <hi>two hundred, Men, Women,</hi> and <hi>Children;</hi> and
many more would have done the like, but their <hi>Conſciouſneſs</hi> of
<hi>guilt</hi> made them conclude, that their <hi>Cruelties</hi> and
<hi>barbarous Murthers</hi> could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be forgiven by the
<hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what <hi>Occurrents</hi> happened next ſhall be declared in
their order.</p>
            <p>About the end of <hi>June</hi> News was brought to
<hi>Boſton,</hi> that <hi>Philip</hi> with a <hi>ſmall party</hi> of his
men, lurked about <hi>Swanzy</hi> or <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> &amp; that he might
eaſily be taken; an Indian offering to bring them to the place where they
might find him; whereupon <hi>Souldiers</hi> was <hi>inſtantly ſent away,
from Boſton</hi> who ſpent ſome time in ſearching all the
<hi>woods</hi> on <hi>that ſide of the Country,</hi> 
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:171788:59"/> but
at laſt were forced to return having miſſed of what they aimed at.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plimouth</hi> Colony likewiſe ſent out Souldiers upon the
ſame account, under Major <hi>Bradford,</hi> who by the help of ſome
Indians of <hi>Cape Cod,</hi> alwayes true to the Engliſh intereſt, not
only eſcaped an Ambuſh laid for them, whereby moſt of them might have
been cut off, but ſlew many of thoſe that laid wait for them, without any
loſs to themſelves: yea fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Squaw Sachem of <hi>Sakonet,</hi> one of
<hi>Philips</hi> Allyes, having firſt ſent three Meſſengers to the
Governour of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> to ſue for life and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; promiſing
ſubmiſſion to their Government on that condition, but underſtanding
that <hi>Plimouth Forces</hi> were abroad, before her Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers returned,
ſhe with her People, about ninety in number, rendred themſelves up to Major
<hi>Bradford,</hi> ſo that above one hundred and ten were killed, and taken
upon compoſition that day.</p>
            <p>The like ſucceſs had the <hi>Connecticut Forces</hi> ſent
into the <hi>Narrhagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet Country</hi> under the conduct of the wonderfully

                  </gap>,</hi> Capt. <hi>George Deniſon,</hi> Capt. <hi>Newbery,</hi>
with other worthy Commanders of the ſaid Forces; for about the ſecond of
<hi>July,</hi> 1676, As the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders with the Forces under them were
purſuing the Enemy in, and about the <hi>Narrhaganſet Country</hi> toward
<hi>Mount-hope,</hi> hearing that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> with his black Regiment of
<hi>Wempanoags</hi> was thereabouts, their Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Scouts from the top of an
hill diſcovered a great number of the enemy that had newly pitched their
Station within the ſemicircle of a Swampe. The Engliſh Souldiers were all
mounted on horſeback, to the number of near three hundred; wherefore the
Commanders ordered the Indians to be ready at the top of the hill upon a
ſignal given to run down amain upon the enemy ſecurely lodged in the hollow
of the Swampe juſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite againſt them, while their Horſemen being
divided into two ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons to ride round the hill, ſo that at the ſame
inſtant, both the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men upon the two wings, and the Indians a foot
ruſhing down ſuddenly upon the enemy put them into an horrible fright,
making a lamentable outcry, ſome getting into the Swampe, the reſt that
were prevented by the Horſemen, and the friendly Indians coming ſo
ſuddenly upon them were all taken priſoners; Capt. <hi>Newbery</hi> with
his troop allighting from their horſes ran into the Swampe after them, where
they killed at leaſt an hundred, as was judged by ſome then preſent;
taking alſo many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners out of thoſe habitations of darkneſs; the
enemy ſcarce daring to make any reſiſtance; for none of the Engliſh,
and but one or two of the <hi>Mohegins &amp; Pequods</hi> were hurt in that
aſſault: Yet it was affirmed by a Captain preſent on the place, that with
thoſe they killed and took at <hi>Warwick neck,</hi> in their return home
(which were not much above ſixty) <pb n="96" facs="tcp:171788:60"/>

               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:171788:61"/> that they
killed and took of the enemy at that time above three hundred young and old. At
the ſame time was taken the old Squaw of <hi>Narrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſet,</hi> commonly
called the old Queen.</p>
            <p>They were neceſſitated with this booty to return homewards to
gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the <hi>Mohegin &amp; Pequod</hi> Indians that accompanied them, who
had done them very good ſervice in the purſuit, having loſt one or two of
their men in the chaſe: But their return home, was, as it proved in the
iſſue, more beneficial, then their longer ſtay might have been, to have
made a fruitleſs purſuit after <hi>Philip</hi> (whoſe time was not yet
come al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though haſtning apace) for in their return they met ſixty of the
enemy, all of whom they ſlew and took, ſo as their Sword returned not
empty.</p>
            <p>Within a few dayes after, two hundred of the enemy within
<hi>Plimouth</hi> Juriſdiction being diſtreſſed with Famine, and fear
of danger, came and ſubmitted themſelves to the Goverment there: But three
of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were preſently detected of a cruel murther, and villanous
aſſault upon one Mr. <hi>Clarkes</hi> houſe of <hi>Plimouth;</hi> by a
well minded Squaw that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them (hoping that poſſibly ſuch a
diſcovery would be pleaſing to the Engliſh) and accordingly adjudged
forthwith to undergoe condign puniſhment, which the reſt that ſurrendred
themſelves were no whit troubled at, ſuch kind of Villains, being alwayes
exempted from all acts of favour and mercy. Thoſe two hundred that had newly
ſurrendred themſelves, that they might give ful proof of their fidelity,
offered to lead a Party of the Engliſh to a place not far off, where twenty
more of the enemy might be ſurprized, amongſt whom alſo was one, known to
be a bloudy murtheret of an Engliſh man that year before; accordingly eight
Engliſh men took fourteen of the ſaid <hi>Indians,</hi> and the next day
brought in all the aforeſaid twenty of the enemy, with the ſaid murderer;
who was preſently executed, the reſt being accepted into favour.</p>
            <p>It is affirmed likewiſe that five or ſix Sachems of <hi>Cape
God,</hi> towards the eaſtern part of it, came with three hundred
<hi>Indians</hi> to make peace with the Engliſh, on the 6<hi>th.</hi> of
<hi>July;</hi> one of the ſaid Sachems earneſtly deſiring the Engliſh
that none of them might be ſuffered to ſell any ſtrong Liquors to the
<hi>Indians,</hi> the trading of which, poſſibly hath had no ſmall
influence into the preſent miſchiefs.</p>
            <p>The next day, <hi>July</hi> the 7<hi>th.</hi> a ſmall party of
ours, with a few friendly or Chriſtian <hi>Indians</hi> with them, killed and
took ſeven of the enemy in the woods not far from <hi>Dedham,</hi> one of
which was a <hi>Narrhaganſet Sachem;</hi> who either himſelf, informed, or
by ſome other at that time, certain intelligence was brought to
<hi>Boſton,</hi> that ſome of our enemy <hi>Indians</hi> were gotten to
<hi>Albany,</hi> informing people there, that they might the more 
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:171788:61"/> eaſily get powder and amunition, that the Engliſh and
they were now at peace: One of the ſaid Indians was the Sachem of
<hi>Springfield,</hi> a bloudy and deceitfull villain; It is hoped that he is
now taken in the ſnare from whence he ſhall never be ſuffered to
eſcape.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philip</hi> by this time could not but think his ruine
haſtned apace; yet that he might, in imitation of him that ſtirred up all
this miſchief, expreſs the more wrath, becauſe he knew his time was but
ſhort, intended if poſſible, to deſtroy one town more of the Engliſh
before his turn came; wherefore <hi>July,</hi> 11. with all the Force he could
get, or that he had left he intended to ſet upon <hi>Taunton,</hi> having as
was conceived, many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds in his company; but his deſign being ſtrangly
diſcovered by a Negroe, whom they had taken captive a little before, that
having lived near the <hi>Indians</hi> before, underſtood much of their
Language, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his eſcape from them, acquainted the Inhabitants with
the plot; who having timely notice, furniſhed themſelves with Souldiers,
whereby they were able to repulſe the enemy upon his firſt approach: ſo
as he only fired two houſes, and then fled away: <hi>Except the Lord keepeth
the City the Watchman watcheth but in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 22<hi>d.</hi> of this moneth of <hi>July,</hi> as is hinted
before, the Companyes ſent from <hi>Concord, May,</hi> 30. up towards
<hi>Hadly,</hi> having ſpent much time and paines in purſuit of
<hi>Philip</hi> all the Country over (whom they could not yet overtake) having
tired themſelves with many long and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Marches through the deſert
woods, before they returned home ſome of them were ſent toward
<hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> yet was their labour well improved, and followed with good
ſucceſs at the laſt: for in ranging thoſe woods in <hi>Plimouth
Colony,</hi> they killed and took, by the help of Capt. <hi>Moſely</hi>'s
Company and Capt. <hi>Brattles</hi> Troop joyning with Major <hi>Bradfords</hi>
Company of <hi>Plimouth Colony,</hi> an hundred and fifty Indians, with the
loſs of never an Engliſh man.</p>
            <p>It was feared that <hi>Philip</hi> and his Company would have
returned into the <hi>Nipnet Country,</hi> to prevent which, ſeveral
Horſemen were ſent to guard the paſſage; but he lurked about his own
Country in ſwamps and other ſecret places, where he was as yet hid from the
ſight of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, although many times they hapned to lodge very near
him, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as an Indian Captive promiſed in two hours time to bring our
Souldiers to the very place where he was; but they not being able to paſs the
neareſt way, came a little too late; for they being ſo hotly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued,
haſted away, leaving much of their treaſure behind them; their Kettles
boiling over the fire, their dead unburyed, and twenty of their party were
overtaken, that fell into the Engliſh hands: <hi>Philip</hi> himſelf, 
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:171788:62"/> and ſome few of his ſtragling followers, making their
eſcape by a Raft over an arm of the Sea, into another neck of land on
<hi>Pocaſſet</hi> ſide, not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to truſt himſelf any longer in
<hi>Metapoyſet</hi> woods, ſo full of our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Souldiers, as well
thoſe of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> as of the <hi>Maſſachuſets Colony,</hi> who
almoſt every day meeting with ſome of his party, much leſſened his
number. Capt. <hi>Church,</hi> that active and unwearied Commander of
<hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth Colony,</hi> was at this time as well as long before, out upon
the chaſe with but eighteen Engliſh, and twenty two Indians that were
friends, had four ſeveral ingagements with <hi>Philips</hi> party, wherein he
ſpoiled ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty ſix of the enemy, without the loſs of one of his own
men. In ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of theſe skirmiſhes, thoſe Indians that upon
ſubmiſſion had their lives given them, have done notable ſervice in
hunting out the enemy in all their lurking places.</p>
            <p>At another time they took <hi>Philips Squaw,</hi> and one of his
chief Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors; and about that ſame time, another Sachem about
<hi>Pocaſſet,</hi> with forty <hi>Indians</hi> ſubmitted himſelf to the
Government of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> on pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of life and liberty.</p>
            <p>It ſeemed that now the time of our deliverance was come, and the
time alſo for the deſtruction of our enemyes: for the laſt week in
<hi>July,</hi> the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> underſtanding that ſome
<hi>Indians</hi> were ſeen roving up and down the woods about
<hi>Dedham,</hi> almoſt ſtarved for want of victuals, ſent a ſmall
Company of twenty ſix Souldiers, with about nine or ten Chriſtian Indians,
who purſued and took fifty of the enemy, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny loſs to the
Engliſh; at which time alſo, a good quantity of <hi>Wampam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peag</hi> and
powder was taken from the enemy. That which increaſed this victory was the
ſlaughter of <hi>Pomham,</hi> who was one of the ſtouteſt and moſt
valiant Sachems that belonged to the <hi>Narhaganſets;</hi> whoſe courage
and ſtrength was ſo great, that after he had been mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wounded in the
fight, ſo as himſelf could not ſtand; yet catching hold of an
Engliſh-man that by accident came near him, had done him a miſchief, if he
had not been preſently reſcued by one of his Fellowes. Amongſt the reſt
of the Captives at that time, was one of the ſaid <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> ſons, a
very likely youth, and one whoſe countenance would have beſpoke favour for
him, had he not belonged to ſo bloudy &amp; barbarous an <hi>Indian</hi> as
his father was.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſucceſſes being daily bruited abroad among the
Indians, put many of them into a trembling condition, not knowing well how to
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of themſelves: ſome that had been leſs active in theſe
Tragedies, and were rather led by others, then any wiſe inclined to
miſchief them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, adventured to ſubmit themſelves, of which number
was one of <pb n="101" facs="tcp:171788:62"/> 
               <hi>Nipnet Sachems,</hi> called Sagamore
<hi>John,</hi> who <hi>July</hi> 27. came to ſurrender himſelf to the
Governour and Council of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> at <hi>Boſton,</hi>
bringing along with him one hundred and eighty of the Enemy Indians. This
<hi>John</hi> that he might the more ingratiate himſelf with the Engliſh,
whoſe friendſhip he was now willing to ſeek after, did by a wile get into
his hands, one <hi>Matoonas,</hi> an old malicious Villain, who was the firſt
that did any miſchief within the <hi>Maſſachuſets Colony,</hi> July.
14. 1675. baring an old grudge againſt them as is thought, for juſtice that

Pole near the Gibbet where he was hanged up: the bringing in of this malicious
Caitife, was an hopeful preſage, that it would not be long before
<hi>Philip</hi> himſelf, the grand Villain, would in like manner receive a
juſt reward of his Wickedneſs and Murders.</p>
            <p>Sagamore <hi>John,</hi> that came in <hi>July</hi> 27. affirmed,
that he had never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended any miſchief to the Engliſh at
<hi>Brookefield</hi> the laſt year (near which Village it ſeems his place
was) but that <hi>Philip</hi> coming over-night amongſt them, he was forced,
for fear of his own life, to joyn with them againſt the Engliſh.
<hi>Matoonas</hi> alſo when he was brought before the Council, and asked what
he had to ſay for himſelf, confeſſed that he had rightly deſerved
Death, and could expect no other, adding withal, that if he had followed their
Counſel, he had not come to this; for he had often ſeemed to favour the
Praying Indians, and the Chriſtian Religion, but like <hi>Simon Magus,</hi>
by his after practiſe, diſcovered quickly, that he had no part nor portion
in that matter.</p>
            <p>About this time ſeveral parties of Engliſh, within
<hi>Plimouth</hi> Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, were willing to have a hand in ſo good a
matter, as catching of <hi>Philip</hi> would be, who perceiving that he was now
going down the wind, were willing to haſten his fall. Amongſt others a
ſmall party, <hi>July</hi> 31. went out of <hi>Bridge-water</hi> upon
diſcovery, and by providence were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to fall upon a Company of Indians
where <hi>Philip was,</hi> they came up with them, and killed ſome of his
ſpecial Friends, <hi>Philip</hi> himſelf was next to his Uncle, that was
ſhot down, and had the Souldier that had his choice which to ſhoot at,
known which had been the right Bird, he might as well have taken him as his
Uncle; but tis ſaid that he had new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cut off his Hair, that he might not be
known: the party that did this exploit were few in number, and therefore not
being able to keep alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether cloſe in the reer, that cunning Fox eſcaped
away through the Buſhes undiſcerned in the reer of the Engliſh: that
which was moſt remarkable in this deſign, was that trembling fear
diſcerned to be upon the Indians at this time, inſomuch that one of them
having a Gun in his <pb n="102" facs="tcp:171788:63"/> hand well laden, yet was not able to
ſhoot it off, but ſuffered an Engliſh Souldier to come cloſe up to his
breaſt, and ſo ſhot him down, the other not being able to make any
reſiſtance: nor was any of the Engliſh hurt at, this time.</p>
            <p>The like terror was ſeen in others at that time, for within two
days after, Capt. <hi>Church,</hi> the terror of the Indians in
<hi>Plimouth</hi> Colony, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in purſuit of <hi>Philip,</hi> with but
thirty Engliſh-men, and twenty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled Indians, took twenty three of the
Enemy, and the next day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing them by their Tracks, fell upon their
Head-quarters, and killed and took about an hundred and thirty of chem, but
with the loſs of one Engliſh man: in this engagement God did appear in a
more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary manner to fight for the Engliſh, for the Indians by their
number, and other advantages of the place, were ſo conveniently provided,
that they might have made the firſt ſhot at the Engliſh, and done them
much damage; but one of their own Country-men in Capt. <hi>Churches
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi> eſpying them, called aloud unto them in their own Language,
telling them, <hi>that if they ſhot a Gun, they were all dead men;</hi> with
which they were ſo amazed, that they durſt not once offer to fire at the
Engliſh, which made the victory the more remarkable: <hi>Philip</hi> made a
very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row eſcape at that time, being forced to leave his Treaſures, his
beloved Wife and only Son, to the mercy of the Engliſh, <hi>Skin for Skin,
all that a man hath will he give for his life:</hi> His ruine being thus
gradually carried on, his miſery was not prevented but augmented thereby;
being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf made acquainted with the ſence and experimental feeling of
the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of his Children, loſs of Friends, ſlaughter of his Subjects,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reavement of all Family Relations, and being ſtript of all outward
Comforts, before his own life ſhould be taken away. Such Sentence ſometime
paſſed upon <hi>Cain,</hi> made him cry out, <hi>that his puniſhment was
greater then he could bare.</hi>

               <hi>Auguſt</hi> 6. An Indian willing to ſhift for himſelf
fled to <hi>Taunton,</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to lead any of the Engliſh that would
follow him, to a party of Indians, which they might eaſily apprehend, which
twenty attempted, and accordingly ſeized the whole Company, to the number of
twenty ſix all but that Squaw Sachem her ſelf, who intending to make an
eſcape from the danger, attempted to get over a River, or arm of the Sea near
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:171788:63"/> by, upon a Raft or ſome pieces of broken wood; but
whether tired and ſpent with ſwimming, or ſtarved with cold and hunger,
ſhe was found ſtark naked in <hi>Metapoiſet,</hi> not far from the
water-ſide, which made ſome think, that ſhe was firſt half drowned, and
ſo ended her wretched life, juſt in that place where the year before ſhe
had helped <hi>Philip</hi> to make his eſcape: her head being cut off and
ſet upon a Pole in <hi>Taunton,</hi> was known by ſome Indians then
Priſoners, which ſet them into an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Lamentation; but ſuch was the
righteous hand of God, in bringing at the laſt that miſchief upon
themſelves, which they had without cauſe thus long acted againſt
others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philip,</hi> like a Salvage and wild Beaſt, having been
hunted by the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Forces through the Woods, above an hundred miles
backward and forward, at laſt was driven to his own Den, upon
<hi>Mount-hope,</hi> where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring himſelf, with a few of his beſt
Friends into a Swamp, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved but a Priſon to keep him faſt, till the
Meſſengers of death, came by Divine permiſſion to execute vengeance
upon him, which was thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed.</p>
            <p>Such had been his inveterate malice and wickedneſs againſt the
engliſh that deſpairing of mercy from them, he could not bear that any
thing ſhould be ſuggeſted to him about a Peace, inſomuch as he cauſed
one of his Confederates to be killed, for propounding an expedient of peace;
which ſo provoked ſome of his Company, not altogether ſo deſperate as
himſelf, that one of them (being near of kin to him that was killed) fled to
Road-Iſland, whither, that active Champion Capt. <hi>Church</hi> was newly
retired, to recruit his men for a little time, being much tired with hard
marches all that week) informing them that <hi>Philip</hi> was fled to a Swamp
in <hi>Mount-hope,</hi> whether he would undertake to lead them that would
purſue him. This was welcome news, and the beſt Cordial, for ſuch Martial
Spirits: whereupon he immediately, with a ſmall Company of men, part
Engliſh and part Indians, began another March, which ſhall prove fatal to
<hi>Philip,</hi> and end that controverſie betwixt the engliſh and him: for
coming very early to the ſide of the Swamp, his Souldiers began preſently
to ſurround it, and whether the Devil appeared to him in a Dream that night,
as he did unto <hi>Saul,</hi> foreboding his Tragical end (it matters not) as
he intended to make his eſcape out of the Swamp, he was ſhot through the
Heart by an Indian of his own Nation as is ſaid, that had all this while kept
himſelf in a neutrality until this time, but now had the caſting vote in
his power, by which he determined the quarrel that had held ſo long in
ſuſpence; in him is fulfilled what was ſaid in the Prophet, <hi>Wo to
thee that ſpoileſt, and thou waſt not ſpoiled, and dealeſt 
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:171788:64"/> treacherouſly and they dealt not treacherouſly with
thee; when thou ſhalt ceaſe to ſpoil thou ſhalt be ſpoiled, and when
thou ſhalt make an end to deal treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, they ſhall deal
treacherouſly with thee,</hi> Iſai. 33.1.</p>
            <p>With <hi>Philip</hi> at this time fell five of his truſtieſt
Followers, of whom one was ſaid to be the Son of his chief Captain, that had
ſhot the firſt Gun at the Engliſh the year before. This was done
<hi>Auguſt</hi> 12. 1676. a remarkable teſtimony of divine favour to the
Colony of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> who had for their former ſucceſſes,
appointed the 17<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, to be kept as
a day of ſolemn Thanksgiving to Almighty God. There having been ſo
ſtrange a turn of providence obſerved in the late ſucceſſes obtained
in and about <hi>Plimouth</hi> Colony, it may not be amiſs here to enquire
into the occaſions that did lead thereunto, and alſo into the progreſs
and continuance thereof, after the ſlaughter of <hi>Philip</hi> that grand
Rebel.</p>
            <p>In the precedent Narration frequent mention hath been made of one
Capt. <hi>Church,</hi> whom God hath made an inſtrument of ſignal Victories
over the Indians in that Colony, and of great advantage in that reſpect to
that whole Juriſdiction. It hapened that the ſaid Capt. <hi>Church</hi>
ſome time in <hi>June</hi> laſt, <hi>viz.</hi> of this preſent year,
1676. paſſing over in a Canoo from <hi>Pocaſſet</hi> to
<hi>Road-Iſland,</hi> as he uſed frequently to do (having had much
imployment upon the ſaid Neck of Land, ſo called) ſeveral Indians whom he
had known before at <hi>Lakenham</hi> (a Village on <hi>Pocaſſet
ſide</hi>) beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him, as if they had a mind to ſpeak with him; he
having had ſo much experience as well as others of their Treachery, was not
willing to adventure preſently to come near them; but when they ſeemed to
urge very much, and made many ſigns to him, and at laſt laid down their
Guns in his ſight, he began to think with himſelf, there might be
ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the matter more then ordinary, therefore reſolved to go a
little nearer to the ſhore, and then he perceived they had a great minde to
ſpeak with him, uſing much importunity for that end, inſomuch as he
ventured to go a ſhore amongſt them, having but one Engliſh-man, and two
Indians with him, he directed them to keep off the Canoo, while he
diſcourſed with the Indians aſhore: as ſoon as ever he came amongſt
them; they told him they were weary of fighting, and that they had fought ſo
long by <hi>Philips</hi> inſtigation, but they could not tell for what end,
and therefore were reſolved they would fight no longer; and that which they
deſired of him only was, that he would make way for them to the Governour,
that they might live quietly amongſt the Engliſh, as they had done before,
and that they would deliver up their Arms, or would go out with them, if he
pleaſed to accept of them, and fight for him: <pb n="105" facs="tcp:171788:64"/> to that
end they deſired a time to parly with him, further about that buſineſs,
at what time and place he would appoint: He told them he would meet them two
dayes after at <hi>Saconet,</hi> a place up higher upon the ſaid neck, about
twelve a clock; accordingly he came to the ſaid place, and found the ſame
Indians, with ſome others, and their <hi>Sunke Squaw,</hi> or chief woman of
that Indian Plantation, there ready to meet him.</p>
            <p>After they had fallen into diſcourſe about the beginning of
the warr, as well as the ſucceſs and miſchief of it, they would have put
the blame off from themſelves, and laid it upon the Engliſh: But he
preſently convinced them by an undeniable evidence, that they firſt began
the warr; For ſaid he upon this <hi>Pocaſſet, July,</hi> 7. 1675. you
firſt fought with ſome of <hi>Road-Iſland,</hi> whereof one was my own
Servant, whoſe leg you brake, and the ſame day you ſhot at my ſelf and
Company, before ever we medled with you: They were ſo fully convinced
herewith, that they found nothing to reply, but fell into other diſcourſe
about a peace, which they ſeemed very deſirous to obtain upon any equal
tearms, as was ſaid before.</p>
            <p>There were about fifteen of the Indians preſent, beſide their
<hi>Sunke Squaw</hi> (which is with us their Governeſs or Lady) in
concluſion they engaged for ever after to leave <hi>Philip,</hi> and to goe
out with him; which they did forthwith, as ſoon as he had obtained a peace
for them with the Governour.</p>
            <p>It is here to be minded, that theſe were not properly
<hi>Philips Indians,</hi> but belonged to the <hi>Sakonet Squaw,</hi> who was
nearly related to <hi>Philip,</hi> and her Subjects had hitherto fought in
<hi>Philips</hi> Quarrell, till they ſaw nothing but miſery and miſchief
like to be the iſſue of it to themſelves, as well as their neighbours.
About twenty or thirty of theſe <hi>Sakonet Indians</hi> have conſtantly
gone out with Capt. <hi>Church</hi> ever ſince, and not only been faithfull
and ſerviceable to him, but very ſucceſsfull in every enterpriſe they
have gone about, nor hath he loſt any of them in any skirmiſh with the
other Indians: And it is ſaid that this act of theſe Indians broke
<hi>Philips</hi> heart, as ſoon as ever he underſtood it, ſo as he never
joyed after, or had any ſucceſs in any of his deſigns, but loſt his men
one time after another, till himſelf at laſt fell into the hands of theſe
Indians under Capt. <hi>Churches</hi> Command: For at the ſwamp when
<hi>Philip</hi> was ſlain, Capt. <hi>Church</hi> appointed an Engliſh man
and an Indian to ſtand at ſuch a place of the ſwampe, where it hapned
that <hi>Philip</hi> was breaking away; the morning being wet and rainy, the
Engliſh mans gun would not fire, the Indian having an old Musket with a large
touch-hole, <pb n="106" facs="tcp:171788:65"/> it took fire the more readily, with which
<hi>Philip</hi> was diſpatched, the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let paſſing directly through his
heart, where <hi>Joab</hi> thruſt his darts into rebellious
<hi>Abſalom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus did divine vengeance retalliate upon this notorious Traitor,
that had againſt his league and Covenant, riſen up againſt the Government
of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> to raiſe up againſt him one of his own people, or one
that was in league with him, as he was with the Engliſh: The Indian that did
this execution was called <hi>Alderman</hi> of <hi>Sakonet</hi> that had never
done any act of hoſtility againſt the Engliſh.</p>
            <p>By theſe paſſages it is manifeſt, that as <hi>the hearts
of all are in the hand of God, ſo he turns them as he pleaſes,</hi> either
to favour his people, or to hate and deal ſubtilly with his Servants, as
ſeems good to him.</p>
            <p>Since this engagement with the <hi>Sakonet Indians,</hi> to leave
<hi>Philip,</hi> and to goe out with Capt. <hi>Church,</hi> it is credibly
affirmed; that ſuch hath been their ſucceſs, that ſince <hi>June</hi>
aforeſaid, to the end of <hi>October</hi> next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there have been
ſeven hundred Indians ſubdued, either by killing or taking Captive, by the
meanes of Capt. <hi>Church</hi> and his Company, part Indians and part
Engliſh, beſides three hundred that have come in vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily to ſubmit
themſelves to the Government of <hi>Plimouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appears thus by the ſequell of things, that after the Lord
hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed his work upon his people, that he is beginning to call his
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemyes to an account, and puniſh them for the pride of their hearts, and
for all their treachery and cruelty againſt his Servants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philips</hi> Captains have run the ſame fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> with himſelf, ſome before and
ſome after his own Fall.</p>
            <p>In <hi>June</hi> laſt one <hi>Tiaſhq</hi> a great Captain of
his, his wife and child, or children being taken, though he eſcaped himſelf
at firſt, yet came ſince and ſurrendred himſelf.</p>
            <p>The next noted Captain of <hi>Philips Indians</hi> that was
brought in after <hi>Philips</hi> death, was one called <hi>Teſpiquin,</hi> a
notorious Villain, next to <hi>Philip,</hi> he was called the black
Sachemsſon: It was this <hi>Teſpiquin</hi> that burnt ſo many houſes in
<hi>Plimouth</hi> lately. Capt. <hi>Church</hi> with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany were in
purſuit of him in <hi>September</hi> laſt, two dayes before they could get
near him, at the laſt on the third day, they found the track made by the
ſaid <hi>Teſpiquins</hi> party, as they went to fetch apples from the
Engliſh Orchards: This was ſomething a blind track, therefore they were
forced to take up their quarters that night without diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any place of
their Rendezvouze. The next morning about nine of the clock, they came to their
firſt Rendezvouze, from which they were newly gone: at one a clock they came
to the ſecond, and miſſing <pb n="107" facs="tcp:171788:65"/> them there, they ſoon
after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the third track, wherein
after they had marched awhile, they perceived they grew very near them, by the
crying of a child which they heard: the place was near <hi>Lakenham</hi> upon
<hi>Pocaſſet</hi> neck, ſo full of buſhes that a man could not ſee a
rod before him: Capt. <hi>Church</hi> ordered his men to march up together in
one ranke, becauſe he diſcovered the Indians were laid in one Range by
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral fires; ſo that by that time they all came up into an even ranke
pretty near together, within a few yards of them, as he had appointed, they all
ſuddenly ruſhed altogether in upon them, and catched hold of them, not
ſuffering any to eſcape; there being about fifty of them in all:
<hi>Teſpequins</hi> wife and children were there, but himſelf was abſent;
as alſo one <hi>Jacob,</hi> and a girle that belonged to that company. The
Captains leiſure would not ſerve him to wait till they came in, (though the
Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſaid they might come that night) wherefore he thought upon this
project; to leave two old <hi>Squawes</hi> upon the place, with victuals, and
bid them tell <hi>Teſpiquin,</hi> that he ſhould be his Captain over his
Indians if he were found ſo ſtout a man, as they reported him to be; for
the Indians had ſaid that <hi>Teſpiquin</hi> could not be pierced by a
bullet, for ſaid they, he was ſhot twice, but the bullets glanced by him
and could not hurt him. Thus the Captain marched away with his booty, leaving
this Trap be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him to take the reſt; the next morning he came to ſee
what his Trap had catch'd, there he found <hi>Jacob</hi> aforeſaid (a
notorious wretch) and the girle he miſſed before, but not
<hi>Teſpiquin:</hi> But within a day or two after, the ſaid
<hi>Teſpiquin,</hi> upon the hopes of being made a Captain under Capt.
<hi>Church,</hi> came after ſome of the Company, and ſubmitted himſelf in
the Captains abſence; and was ſent to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> but upon tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
(which was the condition on which his being promiſed a Captains place under
Capt. <hi>Church</hi> did depend) he was found penetrable by the Engliſh
gunns, for he fell down at the firſt ſhot, and thereby received the juſt
reward of his former wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>About a Fort night after the ſurpriſing of
<hi>Teſpiquin,</hi> was one <hi>Totoſons</hi> company taken, wherein were
above fifty perſons: but <hi>Totoſon</hi> himſelf eſcaped, and is out
ſtill in Rebellion, unleſs vengeance hath overtaken him ſince.</p>
            <p>The next that was ſeized after the former, was one called
<hi>Annawan;</hi> a very ſubtle, politick Fellow, and one of <hi>Philips</hi>
chief Counſellors; he had about twelve men, and as many Women and Children in
his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, who were diſcovered by their ſhooting at the Engliſh
Horſes, and other Cattle; ſome of whom being taken, they made known the
reſt. Capt. <hi>Church</hi> at that time had but five Engliſh men, and
twenty Indians. <pb n="108" facs="tcp:171788:66"/> The place where this <hi>Annawan</hi> had
betaken himſelf, was a ledge of Rocks inacceſſible, but at one place,
which by a few hands, might eaſily have been defended againſt a great
number of Aſſailants: but Capt. <hi>Church</hi> by direction got up to
their Wigwams before they were aware: and pleaſantly told <hi>Annawan,</hi>
that he came to ſup with him that night; whereat the ſaid <hi>Annawan</hi>
(who had fallen flat upon the Earth, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have his head cut off)
looked up and cried <hi>Taubut,</hi> in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; <hi>thank you,</hi> as
one being much affected with the generoſity of our Engliſh Captain; they
found ſome of the Engliſh Beef boyling in their Kettles: After Supper much
diſcourſe had with the ſaid <hi>Annawan,</hi> they lay down to ſleep
together in the Wigwam: Capt. <hi>Church</hi> laying one of his legs upon
<hi>Anawans</hi> Son, and the other upon himſelf, that he might have notice,
if any of them offered to ſtir: after midnight <hi>Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wan</hi> roſe up,
and Capt. <hi>Church</hi> was preſently awake, and intended to watch after
his Priſoner: he thought at the firſt he might have gone forth upon ſome
neceſſary occaſion; but not long after, he returned again, having fetched
out of a Swamp hard by, two Horns of Powder and a large Belt of Peag,
ſuppoſed to be <hi>Philips</hi> Belt, all which he delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Capt.
<hi>Church,</hi> in way of thankful acknowledgement of his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie.
Amongſt other Diſcourſe that paſſed between them, concerning the
occaſion of the War, and carrying of it on: the Indian would fain have
excuſed <hi>Philip,</hi> and layd the blame upon the Praying Indians (as they
are diſtinguiſhed from others by that Character) and others of the younger
ſort of his Followers, who coming with their ſeveral tales (which he
likened to ſticks laid on a heap) till by the multitude of them a great fire
came to be kindled: they make much uſe of parabolical expreſſions; for
ſo ſaid <hi>Solomon, Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out;
ſo where there is no tale-bearer, the ſtrife ceaſeth,</hi> Prov. 26.20.
But <hi>Philip</hi> had had large and long experience of the gentleneſs and
kindneſs of the Engliſh, both to himſelf and to his People, ſo as
unleſs he had born an evil and malicious mind againſt the Engliſh, he
would never have hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to thoſe ſtories, contrary to his faithful
promiſe and Allegiance.</p>
            <p>The ſaid <hi>Annawan</hi> confeſſed alſo, that he did
believe by all thoſe late occurrents, that there was a great God, that
over-ruled all; and that he had found, that whatever he had done to any of
thoſe, whether Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans or Engliſh, the ſame was brought upon himſelf
in after time. He confeſſed alſo, that he had put to death ſeveral of
the Engliſh, that they had taken alive, ten in one day: and could not deny,
but that ſome of them had been tortured: and now he could not but ſee the
juſtice of the great God upon himſelf, with many other things of like
nature. <pb n="109" facs="tcp:171788:66"/> But whatever his confeſſions of this nature
were, being forced from him by the power of Conſcience, after he was
delivered up to Authority, he was put to death, as he juſtly had
deſerved.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid that <hi>Philip</hi> when he firſt began his
Rebellion, had about three hundred fighting men under him, beſides thoſe
that belonged to his Kins-woman, <hi>Wetamoe,</hi> drowned about
<hi>Taunton,</hi> that had almoſt as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny under her, as himſelf. And one
<hi>Quenopin,</hi> a <hi>Narrhaganſet</hi> Sachem, that lived near him, and
joyned with him in his quarrel with the Engliſh: But it is certain that there
are ſcarce any that are now left that belonged to either of them: ſo as
although the Almighty hath made uſe of them to be a ſcourge to his People,
he hath now turned his hand againſt them, to their utter deſtruction, and
extirpation from off the face of the earth, peradventure to make room for
others of his People to come in their room, and in their ſtead.</p>
            <p>As for the reſt of the <hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> that joyned in
<hi>Philips</hi> quarrel, it is already declared, what end they were come unto.
As for the reſt of the Indians, whither <hi>Nipnet, Naſhaway,
Pacomptuck,</hi> or <hi>Hadly</hi> and <hi>Springfield</hi> Indians; it is not
ſo certain what is become of them: But after their ſeparation one from the
other about <hi>July laſt;</hi> it was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by all the Tracks in
thoſe Woods, they went ſtill weſtward, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of
<hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, a great party of them were obſerved to paſs by
<hi>Weſtfield,</hi> a ſmall Town to the weſt of <hi>Springfield,</hi> and
were judged to be about two hundred: News thereof being brought to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
<hi>Talcot,</hi> he with the Souldiers of <hi>Connecticut Colony</hi> under his
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, both Engliſh and Indians, purſued after them as far as
<hi>Auſotun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noog</hi> River (in the middle way betwixt <hi>Weſt field,</hi>
and the <hi>Dutch River,</hi> and <hi>Fort Albany</hi>) where he overtook them,
and fought with them; kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and taking Priſoners forty five, whereof
twenty five were fighting men, without the loſs of any one of his Company
beſides a <hi>Mohegin</hi> Indian: many of the reſt were ſorely wounded,
as appeared by the dab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the Buſhes with blood, as was obſerved by
them that followed them a little further.</p>
            <p>It is written ſince from <hi>Albany,</hi> that there were
ſundry loſt beſides the forty five forementioned, to the number of
threeſcore in all; and alſo that an hundred and twenty of them are ſince
dead of ſickneſs: ſo as Vengeance ſeems to be purſuing of them as
well as the reſt.</p>
            <p>Several of their Friends that belonged to <hi>Naſhaway,</hi> and
the places adjoyning, repaired to <hi>Paſcataqua,</hi> hoping to ſhrowd
themſelves under the Wings of ſome honeſter Indians about
<hi>Quechecho,</hi> under pretence <pb n="110" facs="tcp:171788:67"/> of a Declaration ſet
out by the Governour and Council of the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſets</hi> in the
beginning of <hi>July</hi> laſt: but ſome of our Forces, under Capt.
<hi>Hathorne</hi> and Capt. <hi>Sill,</hi> with the help of Major
<hi>Walden,</hi> Captain <hi>Froſt,</hi> and others reſiding in thoſe
parts, being then in a readineſs, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the vile, and wicked from the
reſt, and ſent them down to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour at <hi>Boſton,</hi> where
eight or nine of the Ring-leaders, ſuch as one eyed <hi>John,</hi> Sagamore
<hi>Sam</hi> of <hi>Naſhaway,</hi> chief Actors of the late out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, and
bloudy miſchiefs had juſtice done upon them ſoon after.</p>
            <p>As for the Maſſacres and Calamities that befel the Engliſh
further Eaſtward, they ſhall in the ſecond part of this Narrative be
declared.</p>
            <p>The Indians being thus diſperſed ſeveral wayes, were
ſtrangly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and deſtroyed one parcel after another, untill there
was none left in the weſtern or ſouthern parts, that durſt make any
oppoſition all the following part of the year.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe that fled weſtward toward <hi>Albany,</hi> we
ſhall there leave them for the preſent, wiſhing we may never hear more of
them: Only a perſon of Quality informeth, that at <hi>Hartford,</hi> in
<hi>September</hi> laſt, he was preſent at the examination of one
<hi>Choos,</hi> an <hi>Indian,</hi> formerly of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> but one
of the <hi>Narrhaganſet Fort</hi> the laſt winter, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that
he was one of that Company of Indians that went weſtward the moneth before
toward <hi>Hudſons River;</hi> but after the fight at
<hi>Auſotun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noog,</hi> he ſaid he returned back to <hi>Connecticut</hi> for
fear of the <hi>Mohawks;</hi> and that he lay hid about <hi>Farmington,</hi>
till he was almoſt ſtarved; and then he went to the Sea-ſide, to make
uſe of the Oiſter bank at <hi>Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> for his relief, where he was
eſpyed by the Indians, and ſo brought to <hi>Hartford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He affirmed, that there were above two hundred and fifty fighting
men amongſt thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> that fled weſtward, beſides women
and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and that near two hundred of them paſſed the great River
below <hi>Albany,</hi> and were ſheltered by the Indians of that place,
called <hi>Mohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganders;</hi> but about eighty of them tarried on the hither
ſide of that <hi>River</hi> near a <hi>Dutch</hi> village. But he being
convicted of fighting againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> was condemned to dye,
and executed about the ſame time.</p>
            <p>Some few of the reſt were skulking about the <hi>Narrhaganſet
Country</hi> the laſt Fall, hoping to ſhelter themſelves under
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncas,</hi> but he not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give them countenance againſt the
mind of his friends at <hi>Conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticut,</hi> hath ſince abandoned them to
ſhift for themſelves, who have been moſt of them taken and brought in
priſoners to the Engliſh this winter.</p>
            <p>About the Moneth of <hi>October</hi> laſt, Mr. <hi>Stanton</hi>
chanced to come from <hi>Seaconke</hi> with three <hi>Indians</hi> in his
company <hi>Pequods,</hi> or <hi>Mohegins,</hi> they <pb n="111" facs="tcp:171788:67"/>
hearing by a Captive at one of the next towns that there was a parcel of the
enemy not far off, preſently left Mr. <hi>Stanton,</hi> and purſued after
them, whom they ſoon after overtook, and made them all priſoners: amongſt
them was an old man, not able to goe their pace, but promiſing to come after
them, they ſpared his life: but as ſoon as the men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned at night from
hunting, the old man told them what had befalne their women and children;
whereupon the next morning they preſently following after them, overtook
them, and ſo recovered the priſoners, and ſlew one of the three that
carried them away; the other two hardly eſcaped; one of them is called Major
<hi>Symon,</hi> being part a <hi>Pequod</hi> and part a
<hi>Narrhaganſet,</hi> but of extraordinary ſtrength and courage; he
perceiving the danger they were in, challenged to fight hand to hand with any
five of them with their hatchets; but they unwilling to hang their ſucceſs
upon the hazzard of a ſingle Combate, came all towards him at once, whereupon
firſt diſcharging his gun amongſt the whole Company, he brake through
them all by force, and ſo eſcaped their hands, with one more that was one
of his companions. This <hi>Symon</hi> hath ſince been very active in killing
and taking many of the enemy; ſome ſay that he with his own hands hath
taken and killed above threeſcore; and either out of hatred to the enemy, or
love to the Engliſh, is this laſt week gone with the Souldiers to the
eaſtward, in purſuit of our quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel againſt them in thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>At another time not long before, when he was out againſt the
enemy; he came ſuddenly upon a great number of them, as they were ſpread
under a ſteep banke, from whence leaping down into the mideſt of them he
killed diverſe, and took others: Fighting it ſeems is a recreation to him,
for he is ſeldome at home above four or five dayes together.</p>
            <p>Some ſay that in one of his former expeditions, being much
wearied and ſpent, he laid him down to ſleep; but towards morning he fell
into a dream, wherein be apprehended the Indians were upon him, where
ſuddenly riſing up he eſpyed the Indians coming toward him; but
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently preſenting his gunns againſt them, he ſo frighted them, that
they gave him an opportunity to make an eſcape from a multitude of them.</p>
            <p>Since the beginning of <hi>December</hi> laſt, News coming down
to <hi>Boſton,</hi> that miſchief was done about <hi>Seaconk,</hi> and
<hi>Rehoboth,</hi> by ſome remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Indians thereabout, killing
their ſwine and horſes; ſeveral of <hi>Medfield</hi> went out after them,
and purſuing them by their track, came upon a ſmall party, of whom they
took three, one of which eſcaped, while ſome of the company were going
after the reſt: They which were taken confeſſed there were a parcell
about threeſcore, that were lurking <pb n="112" facs="tcp:171788:68"/> up and down in
thoſe Woods, the ſaid two Indians were brought into <hi>Boſton,</hi> Jan.
8.</p>
            <p>A Commiſſion was formerly granted to <hi>Peter Ephraim</hi> an
Indian of <hi>Natick,</hi> to go out in purſuit of them, with twenty nine of
his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: a few of the Engliſh went with them from <hi>Medfield,</hi> who
being tired with marching in the Snow ſoon returned. The Indians kept on in
their deſign, and lighted upon a conſiderable party of the Enemy, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
traced them, till they found where they lodged over night; they ſurrounded
them early in the morning, as their manner is, and then offered them quarter,
if they would yield: eight reſolute fellows refuſed, who were preſently
ſhot down, the reſt were all ſeized, the whole being in number forty two.
This was done about the middle of <hi>January</hi> laſt, ſince which time,
ſeveral ſuch exploits have been done by them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jan.</hi> 23. laſt, The ſame Company of <hi>Natick
Indians</hi> took two and twenty of the Enemy, among which were five able men,
and five Arms: they ſent the Priſoners home by five of their Company, the
reſt went further in the chaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jan.</hi> 26. laſt, Another parcel of the Enemy were brought
in, eight in number, of whom five were men; amongſt whom was the Indian
called <hi>Cornelius:</hi> who three years ſince was indicted for killing an
Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans Cow; upon which he is ſaid to have uttered ſeveral
threatning ſpeeches, that he would kill Engliſh men, and their Cows too;
which was now remembred againſt him, when he was in particular called to
account, for having an hand in killing ſome of the Engliſh and Indians
alſo in league with us, for which he was ſentenced to dy, and was
accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly executed on <hi>Febr.</hi> 15. laſt.</p>
            <p>Concerning the reſt of the Indians, either in the Colony of
<hi>Plimouth, Connecticut,</hi> or the <hi>Maſſachuſets;</hi> there is no
occurrent more of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment come to light, ſince the end of <hi>Auguſt</hi>
laſt, ſave what is laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before; yet is it very remarkable that
although tearms of peace were offered to all that would come in and ſurrender
themſelves (as appears by a Declaration put out <hi>July</hi> laſt) and
that a <hi>Nipnet</hi> Sachem called <hi>John,</hi> did thereupon with a
conſiderable number of his Company come in, and offer themſelves, and were
accordingly ſecured of their lives, and other concernments; yet did that
treacherous Varlet make an eſcape away, this winter from Capt.
<hi>Prentices</hi> Houſe (under whoſe charge he was put, about
<hi>Cambridge</hi> Village) and with above twenty more fled away into the
Woods, to ſhift for himſelf, amongſt the reſt of his bloody Companions;
they were preſently purſued, but had gone <pb n="113" facs="tcp:171788:68"/> too faſt
and too far to be overtaken: whither it were conſciouſneſs of their own
guilt, that having had an hand in the bloud of the Engliſh, they feared
vengeance hung over their heads: or whither they liked not the Engliſh
manners ſo well, as to be confined thereunto: wild creatures ordinarily love
the liberty of the woods, better than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of a cage. They made
none acquainted with their deſigne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they went away; and as yet little
account can be given of them: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is known that one or two of their number
have ſince been killed; and that one or two of their Families are entertained
by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncas;</hi> but what is become of the reſt is yet uncertain: There
were but ſeven of the Company men; ſo as they are not capable to do much
miſchief. Some of late have travailed through the woods to
<hi>Connecticut,</hi> but met with no Indians, nor did they hear of any in
their paſſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that place and this.</p>
            <p>And becauſe in the preſent <hi>Narrative,</hi> there hath been
frequent men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncas</hi> the <hi>Mohegin Sachem,</hi> and of
his faithfulneſs to the intereſt of the Engliſh, I adde in this place,
that it is ſuſpected by them that knew him beſt, that in his heart he is
no better affected to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh; or their Religion, then the reſt of his
Country-men; and that it hath been his own advantage, that hath led him to be
thus true to them who have upheld him, as formerly againſt the
<hi>Pequods,</hi> ſo of late againſt the <hi>Narrhaganſets:</hi> yet hath
he not long ſince been convinced of the truth of our Religion, and vanity of
his own, as himſelf hath ſolemnly confeſſed; which will evidently
appear by this following paſſage, which I ſhall here repreſent juſt
as it was, from under the hand of that Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend perſon it relates unto,
<hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Fitch,</hi> Paſtor of the Church at <hi>Norwich,</hi>
near unto which <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncas</hi> his place is.</p>
            <p>There was a great drought the laſt Summer, but as it ſeems, it
was more extream in thoſe parts then with us about the
<hi>Maſſachuſets;</hi> and although probably, the Engliſh might have
prayed for rain themſelves without any motion from the Indians, yet their
addreſs to the ſaid Mr. <hi>Fitch</hi> on ſuch an account, with the
conſequences thereof, is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, which take in his own words,</p>
            <q> 
               <p>Concerning the Drought <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the true Narrative of that
Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is this,</p> 
               <p> In <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, ſuch was the want of rain, that
the Indian corn was not only dryed and parched up, but the apple-trees
withered, the fruit and leaves fell off as in Autumn, and ſome trees ſeemed
to be dead with that Drought: the Indians came into town and did lament their
want of rain, and that their <hi>Powawes</hi> could get none in their way of
worſhip <pb n="114" facs="tcp:171788:69"/> deſiring me that I would ſeek to God for
rain: I appointed a Faſt day for that purpoſe. The day being come, it
proved a cleer day without any clouds, untill nigh ſun ſetting, when we
came from the Meeting, and then ſome Clouds aroſe; the next day remained
cloudy, then <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncas</hi> with many Indians came to my houſe,
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncas</hi> lamented there was ſuch want of Rain; I asked whether if God
ſhould ſend us rain, he would not attribute it to their <hi>Powawes:</hi>
He anſwered no, for they had done their uttermoſt and all in vain: I
replyed, if you will declare it before all theſe Indians, you ſhall ſee
what God will doe for us; For although this year he hath ſhewn his anger
againſt the Engliſh, and not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Indians, yet he hath begun
to ſave us, and I have found by experience twice in the like caſe, when we
ſought him by Faſting and Prayer, he hath given us Rain, and never denyed
us. Then <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncas</hi> made a great ſpeech to the Indians (which were
many) confeſſing that if God ſhould then ſend rain it could not be
aſcribed to their powaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but muſt be acknowledged to be an anſwer of
our prayers. This day the clouds ſpread more and more, and the next day there
was ſuch plenty of rain, that our River roſe more then two foot in
height.</p>
            </q>
            <p>By all that is recorded in the <hi>Narrative</hi> foregoing, there
are none into whoſe hands it ſhall come, but will be ſenſible that the
preſent time hath been a day of great rebuke &amp; trouble to the poor people
ſojourning in this wilderneſs, upon whom ſundry calamities have broke in
at once this laſt as well as in the former years: in many places they have
been viſited with ſickneſs, and mortality more then in many years before,
depriving them of many worthy and uſefull perſons; amongſt others the
loſs of Mr. <hi>John Winthrope</hi> the late worthy Governour of the Colony
of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut,</hi> is as it ought, much lamented by all, who dyed at
<hi>Boſton, April</hi> 5. 1676. in the 73. year of his age, whither he was
occaſionally called the laſt winter to ſit with the reſt of the
Commiſſioners, of the united Colonyes, to conſult about the great affairs
of them, now newly enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in theſe troubles from the Heathen. He was the
eldeſt ſon of the famous Governour of the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi>
deceaſed, <hi>March,</hi> 26, 1649. <hi>Proles ſimilima Paronti.</hi> The
memory of the Father, though he dyed ſo long ago yet lives ſtill in the
minds of the ſurviving Generation, and is like to continue much longer, by
the remembrance of the eminent vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues found in this the eldeſt of his
off-ſpring, who being not long after, or about that time called to take up
his reſidence in that Colony, was by the importunity of the people there,
prevailed with to accept of the Governours place, which for a long time after,
he held over that Colony <pb n="115" facs="tcp:171788:69"/> though annually choſen
thereunto; being ſo well furniſhed with many excellent endowments, as well
moral as political and philoſophical, which rendred him moſt fit to be an
healer of that people. Though we are dealing in another ſubject, yet ſhall
not paſs by his Tomb, as we goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, without paying the homage due to the
memory of ſo honourable a Gentleman.</p>
            <p>After all the forementioned Calamityes and troubles, it pleaſed
God to alarme the town of <hi>Boſton,</hi> and in them the whole Country, by
a ſad Fire, accidentally kindled by the careleſneſs of an Apprentice,
that ſate up too late overnight, as was conceived; which began an hour before
day, continuing three or four, in which time it burned down to the ground forty
ſix dwelling houſes, beſides other Buildings, together with a Meeting
houſe of conſiderable bigneſs: ſome mercy was obſerved mixt with the
judgment, for if a great rain had not continued all the time (the roofs and
walls of their ordinary buildings conſiſting of ſuch combuſtable
matter) that whole end of the town had at that time been conſumed.</p>
            <p>Whereby we ſee that God by his providence can turn our dwellings
into aſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

either forreign or domeſtick enemies. Which conſideration may awaken all
from ſecurity, and confidence in theſe uncertain and unſtable
poſſeſſions, that have no firmer Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that may ſo ſoon
after their firſt erection, be eaten up by the flames of fire, before the

that were not only then preſent, but perſonally concerned and engaged in
that Service.</p>
            <p>THere was a Nation of the Indians in the Southern parts of
<hi>New-England,</hi> called <hi>Pequods,</hi> ſeated on a fair Navigable
River, twelve miles to the Eaſtward of the mouth of the great and famous
River of <hi>Connecticot;</hi> who (as was commonly reported about the time
when <hi>New-England</hi> was firſt planted by the Engliſh) being a more
fierce, cruel, and warlike People then the reſt of the Indians; came down out
of the more inland parts of the Continent, and by force ſeized upon one of
the goodlieſt places near the Sea, and became a terrour to all their 
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:171788:71"/> Neighbours, on whom they had exerciſed ſeveral acts
of in humane cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty; inſomuch that being fleſhed with Victories over
their Fellow-Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; they began to thirſt after the blood of any
Forreigners, <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> that accidentally came
amongſt them, in a way of Trade, or upon other Accounts.</p>
            <p>In the year 1634. they treacherouſly and cruelly murthered
Captain <hi>Stone,</hi> and Captain <hi>Norton,</hi> who came occaſionally
with a Bark into the River to Trade with them. Not long after, within the
compaſs of the next year, they in like treacherous manner, ſlew one Mr.

an Inhabitant of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi>) at <hi>Block Iſland</hi> a

they ſent Meſſengers with gifts to the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> in the

forward Trade with them as their Friends, which was a chief thing aimed at; the
ſaid <hi>Pequods</hi> being at that time in War with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and
the reſt of their Neighbours, on the Reaſons forementioned, to theſe
conditions they readily agreed, and alſo cunningly inſinuated their
deſire that their new Confederates, the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſets</hi> ſhould

<hi>Narrhaganſets;</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating likewiſe then willingneſs that a part
of the Preſent which they promiſed to ſend ſhould be given to them,
ſtanding ſo much upon their honour, that they would not be ſeen to give
any thing themſelves; ſuch was the pride and height of Spirit lodged in
this company of Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Villains, the Dregs and Lees of the Earth, and
Droſſe of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.</p>
            <p>As for Capt. <hi>Stone</hi>'s death they ſtily evaded the guilt
of it, falſly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that there were but two left that had any hand therein,
and that it was a juſt quarrel wherein he was ſlain: for, ſaid they, he
ſurpriſed ſome of our men, and would by force have compelled them to
ſhew him the way up the River, whereupon the ſaid <hi>Stone</hi> coming
aſhore, with two more, was watched by nine of our men (ſay they) who
finding them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep in the night, ſlew them to deliver our own men, one of
whom go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterward to the Barque, it was ſuddenly blown up, whereas the
truth of the matter was thus,</p>
            <p>The ſaid Capt. <hi>Stone</hi> formerly belonging to
<hi>Chriſtophers</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> occaſionally coming to
theſe parts, as he paſſed between this place and <hi>Virginia</hi> put in
at that River, where the Indians after they had been often on board his
Veſſell to trade with him; at the laſt came friendly on board as they
uſed to doe, but finding the Captain aſleep in his Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin, took the
opportunity to murther him as he lay, caſting a Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over him that he
might not be diſcerned by the reſt whom they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after
diſpatched one after another, all but Capt. <hi>Norton,</hi> who made ſtout
reſiſtance, for a long time defending himſelf in the Cook-room of the
Barke, till the gun-powder which he had ſet in an open veſſell, to be
more ready for his uſe, accidentally took fire, by which fatal accident he
was ſo burned &amp; his eyes ſo blinded that he could not make any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
reſiſtance, but forthwith fell into the hands of theſe cruel and
bloud-thirſty wretches, who after they had taken away his life made a prey of
all that was in the Veſſell.</p>
            <p>As for Mr. <hi>Oldman</hi> he was indeed murthered at an Iſland
called by the Indians <hi>Maniſſes</hi> (ſince known among the Engliſh
by the name of <hi>Block-Iſland</hi>) but thoſe that murthered him
(probably Inhabitants of the ſaid Iſland,) fled preſently to the
<hi>Pequods,</hi> by whom they were ſheltered, and <pb n="120" facs="tcp:171788:72"/> ſo
became alſo guilty themſelves of his bloud, which ere long was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged by
them, as is in the next place to be declared.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> after the peace
concluded with the <hi>Pequods,</hi> ſent a Barke thither for trade, that
trial might be made of the reality of their friendſhip, but they found them
treacherous and falſe, and that no advantage was to be had by any commerce
with them, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they took up a reſolution never more to have to doe
with them; which the ſaid Indians perceiving, made no account of the former
peace, but took all advantage to do us miſchief, not only by harbouring
thoſe who had murthered Mr. <hi>Oldham,</hi> but ſurprizing many of the
Engliſh in the year 1636. when <hi>Connecticut River</hi> began firſt to be
planted, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of whom were killed (nine at one time in <hi>April</hi> 1637.)
by them about <hi>Wethersfield,</hi> when the Plantation then firſt began,
ſo as they could not paſs up and down the River without a Guard, but they
would be in danger of being cut off or carried away, as two Maids were ſaid
to be; thirty men have been killed by them in all; thoſe who fell into their
hands alive, were cruelly tortured after a moſt barbarous manner, by
inſulting over their Priſoners in a blaſphemous wiſe, when in their
dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Agonies, under the extremity of their pains (their fleſh being firſt
flaſhed with knives, and then filled with burning Embers; they called upon
God and Chriſt with gaſping groans, reſigning up their Souls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their
hands; with which words theſe wretched Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tifs uſed to mock the Engliſh afterward, when they came within
their hearing and view.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time ſome Agents ſent over by the Lord
<hi>Say,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> built a Fort at the mouth of
<hi>Connecticut River,</hi> wherein was placed one Lieutenant
<hi>Gardiner,</hi> and a convenient number of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to ſecure the place,
intended ſoon after to be planted, but all the winter following
<hi>(ſcil.)</hi> in the end of the year 1636. they were little better then
beſieged by the ſaid Salvages, not daring to ſtir out of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the
Fort, but they were ready to be ſeized by theſe their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Enemies:
At one time the Lieutenant himſelf with ten or twelve of the Souldiers;
marching out of the Fort, with an intent to paſs over a Neck of Land, to burn
the Marſhes; as ſoon as ever they were paſſed over the ſtreight of
the Neck, they eſpyed a Company of Indians making towards the ſaid
Iſtmus, which if they could not reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, they ſee they muſt all
periſh; whereupon returning back with all ſpeed, they very narrowly
eſcaped, and were two or three of them kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led notwithſtanding, before they
could get back into the Fort, which was preſently ſurrounded with
multitudes of them; but the diſcharging of a piece of Ordnance gave them
warning to keep further from the <pb n="121" facs="tcp:171788:72"/> Walls: ſometimes they
came with their Canooes into the river in view of the Souldiers within the
Fort, and when they apprehended themſelves out of reach of their gunns, they
would imitate the dying groans &amp; invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the poor Captive
Engliſh, which the Engliſh Souldiers were forced with ſilent patience to
bear; not being then in a capacity to requite their inſolent blaſphemyes.
But they being by theſe horrible outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges juſtly provoked to indignation,
unanimouſly agreed to joyn their Forces together to root them out of the
earth with Gods Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>The Colony of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> did immediately
ſet about it in the latter end of the Summer (1636) by ſending out
fourſcore men under the Command of Capt. <hi>Endicot</hi> of <hi>Salem;</hi>
who went to the <hi>Pequod Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> by water, with Commiſſion to treat
with the ſaid <hi>Pequods,</hi> firſt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing terms of peace, if they
would ſurrender the Murtherers of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, and forbear further acts of
hoſtility, or elſe fight them.</p>
            <p>The Captain aforeſaid coming aſhore with his Company, by a
meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage ſent them by an interpreter, obtained ſome little ſpeech
with a great number of them at a diſtance; but after they underſtood what
was propounded to them, firſt cunningly getting behind a hill, they
preſently ran away into the Woods and Swamps, where there was no purſuing
of them: however one diſcharging a gun among them as they were taking their
flight, ſtayed the courſe of one, which was all that could be done
againſt them for that time.</p>
            <p>Winter approaching, and no encouragement preſenting further to
purſue them, at that time it was reſolved better to return back for the
preſent, and wait a further ſeaſon when more Forces could be gathered
together to purſue the quarrel to the utmoſt.</p>
            <p>During this interim the <hi>Pequods</hi> perceiving that they had
by ſeveral late injuryes and outrages, drawn upon themſelves the hatred of
all the Engliſh, as well as of their own people by former wrongs; and
diſtruſting their own ability to deal with them all at once, did at the
laſt by all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle inſinuations, and perſwaſions, try to make their
peace with the <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhaganſets,</hi> uſing ſuch Arguments as to right
reaſon ſeemed not only pregnant to the purpoſe, but alſo (if revenge
that bewitching and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing paſſion of mans mind had not blinded their
eyes) moſt cogent and invincible: But they were by the good providence of God
witheld from embracing thoſe counſels, which might otherwiſe have proved
moſt pernicious to the deſign of the Engliſh: <hi>viz.</hi> That the
Engliſh were Strangers, and began to overſpread the Country, the which
would ſoon be poſſeſſed by them to the depriving the ancient
inhabitants of their <pb n="122" facs="tcp:171788:73"/> right, if they were not timely
prevented; and that the <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> would but make way for their
own ruine, by helping to deſtroy the <hi>Pequods;</hi> for after themſelves
were ſubdued, it would not be long ere the <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi>
themſelves, would in the next place be rooted out likewiſe: Whereas if they
would but joyn together againſt the Engliſh they could demonſtrate how
the Engliſh might eaſily either be deſtroyed or forced to leave the
Country, and that without any danger to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: telling them alſo that
they never need come to any open Battles, they might deſtroy them only by
firing their houſes, and killing their Cattle, and lying in wait for them as
they went about their ordinary occaſions; which courſe if it were
purſued, they ſaid their new and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome neighbours could not long
ſubſiſt; but would either be ſtarved with hunger and cold, or forced to
forſake the Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Matchiavel</hi> himſelf if he had fate in counſel with
them could not have inſinuated ſtronger reaſons to have perſwaded them
to a peace.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid that ſo much reaſon was apprehended in theſe
motives, that the <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> were once wavering, and were
almoſt perſwaded to have granted an ear to their advice and perſwaſion
and joyned all againſt the Engliſh; but when they conſidered what an
advantage they had put into their hands by the ſtrength and favour of the
Engliſh, to take a full revenge of all their former injuries, upon their
inveterate Enemies, the thought of that was ſo ſweet that it turned the
ſcale againſt all other conſiderations whatſoever.</p>
            <p>The report of the unheard of cruelties forementioned filling the
ears of the Engliſh throughout the Country; it was agreed by the joynt
conſent of the Engliſh throughout the three Colonies to unite all their
Forces together, for the ſuppreſſing the common Enemy, early in the
Spring <hi>Anno,</hi> 1637. who were alſo moved thereunto by their own
neceſſities as well as by the earneſt requeſt of their Friends at
<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe of <hi>Plimouth</hi> being written unto by the Governour
of the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſets,</hi> appeared very cordially willing thereunto,
to which end they agreed to ſend fifty men at their own charge, with as much
ſpeed as the matter required, with ſufficient Leaders appointed, and a
Barke provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to carry them Proviſions, and tend upon them on all
occaſions; but before they could be diſpatched away the next Spring, News
was brought that the Enemy was wholly routed, ſo as their journey was
ſtopped, and their good will accepted for the deed; as if they really had
been there to have born their part in the Service, their non-appearance in time
and place being not to be imputed to any backwardneſs in their 
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:171788:73"/> minds; but to their too late invitation to the Service;
the motion fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a large compaſs from Connecticut down to the
Maſſachuſets; from whom in the laſt place they were ſolicited
thereunto. And for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two Colonies, thoſe of <hi>Connecticut</hi>
being quickned on by the ſpurr of neceſſity, and preſent ſenſe of
the inſolency daily acted at their very doors, were ſooneſt upon their
March, and by the good hand of God upon them, had given the main ſtroak
before their Friends of the <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſets</hi> could come up with
them, yet was there no repining for the want of the glory of the Victory, nor
was their any cauſe, thoſe that were the chief actors therein being forward
to give God the glory of the whole, and not willing to pocket up any thing
thereof themſelves, acknowledging that they never ſaw more of God, or
leſs of man in any buſineſs of that nature, as may more fully be
underſtood by particulars enſuing.</p>
            <p>The Colony of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> determined to ſend
an hundred and ſixty, of whom an hundred and twenty were ordered under the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Capt. <hi>Patrick</hi> of <hi>Watertown,</hi> and Capt.
<hi>Trask</hi> of <hi>Salem</hi> Capt. <hi>Stoughton</hi> of
<hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> being to command in chief; with whom was ſent that
holy man of God Mr. <hi>John Wilſon</hi> (Paſtor of one Church of
<hi>Boſton</hi>) the Charets and Horſemen of our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by
whoſe Faith and Prayer as ſometimes was ſaid of <hi>Luther</hi> (in
reference to <hi>Germany</hi>) the Country was preſerved, ſo as it was
confidently believed that no Enemy ſhould break in upon a place whilſt he
ſurvived, which as ſome have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved accordingly came to paſs.</p>
            <p>The matter requiring great expedition, and it being long before
the whole company could be diſpatched away, Capt. <hi>Patrick</hi> with forty
men were ſent away before hand, to be ſure to meet with thoſe of
<hi>Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut</hi> in caſe they ſhould be in action, before the reſt
of our Forces could get into a readineſs, which accordingly came to paſs;
for the main buſineſs in taking the Fort was over, even before the ſaid
<hi>Patrick</hi> could get thither. Capt. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderhill</hi> was ſent by
Mr. <hi>Vane</hi> the Governour to <hi>Saybrook</hi> the winter before to
ſtrengthen the Gariſon there. The aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulting and ſurprizing of
which, being the moſt remarkable piece of ſervice in that whole expedition;
take it as it was delivered in writing by that valiant, faithful and prudent
Commander Capt. <hi>Maſon,</hi> chief in the action, who lived long after to
reap the fruit of his labour, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the benefit of that dayes ſervice,
having an Inheritance given him in that part of the Country, as a juſt reward
of his faithful ſervice on that day as well as at other times.
<hi>Wequaſh</hi> a <hi>Pequod</hi> by Nation, but diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the
Sachem, proved a good guide by whoſe direction they were <pb n="124" facs="tcp:171788:74"/> led to a Fort near <hi>Myſtick</hi> River, ſome miles nearer then
<hi>Saſſacous</hi> his Fort, which they firſt intended to
aſſault.</p>
            <p> 'On the ſecond Wedneſday of <hi>May,</hi> being the tenth day
of that Month, we ſet ſayle with ninety men of the Engliſh in one Pink,
one Pinnace, two Boats toward the <hi>Pequods,</hi> with ſeventy River
Indians, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſomewhat a long paſſage to <hi>Saybrook</hi> Fort, about
forty of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians deſired to go down by land on Saturday, but on Munday
they went forth from the Fort, and meeting ſeven <hi>Pequods</hi> and
<hi>Nian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> they ſlew five outright, took one Priſoner and brought
him into <hi>Saybrook</hi> Fort, where he was executed by Captain
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderhill,</hi> the other eſcaped.</p>
            <p> 'On Munday we all landed at <hi>Saybrook</hi> Fort, and ſtayed
there till tueſday; Capt. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderhill</hi> joyning nineteen men with
himſelf to us: whereupon we ſent back twenty of ours to ſtrengthen our
Plantations: and ſo ſet ſayl on thurſday towards
<hi>Narrhaganſet,</hi> and arrived there on fryday.</p>
            <p> 'On Saturday my ſelf, with Capt. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderhill,</hi>
Leiftenant <hi>Sealy,</hi> with our guard marched to <hi>Canonicus</hi> by
land, being about five miles diſtant, where we were kindly entertained after
their manner: having had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him, we ſent to <hi>Miantonimo,</hi> who
would give no preſent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; and ſo our Sabbath being on the morrow, we
adjourned our mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting untill Monday, at which time there aſſembled
<hi>Miantonimo</hi> with the chiefeſt of them about two hundred men; and
being ſolemnly ſet for Conſultation after their manner; we told them we
were now going God aſſiſting, to revenge the wrong committed and bloud
ſhed by their &amp; our enemies, upon our native Country-men, not any way
deſiring their aid, unleſs they would voluntarily ſend, which they did
exceedingly approve of: moreover we told them that the Engliſh and they had
alwayes been friends for ought we knew, &amp; ſo we were with the Indians
that had not wronged Engliſh-men, the which they acknowledged, and ſo made
a large deſcription of the <hi>Pequods</hi> Country, and told us they would
ſend men with us; ſo we reſolved there to keep our rendezvouze at
<hi>Canonicus</hi> his Plantation on the morrow night being Tuesday: but the
wind being ſtiff, we could not land our men till five or ſix of the clock
in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, at which time I landed on <hi>Narrhaganſet</hi> ſhoar
with thirty two men and ſo marched to the place of Rendezvouze formerly
appointed: Capt. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderhill</hi> and my Leiftenant landed the reſt, and
ſo came up to me that night. About two hours before day came an Indian with a
Letter from Capt. <hi>Patrick,</hi> being then at Mr. <hi>Ro. Williams</hi> his
plantation with four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men, who deſired us to ſtay for his coming and
joyning, not intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <pb n="125" facs="tcp:171788:74"/> when that would be: the which
being conſidered and debated, we thought could not be our ſafeſt
courſe, (though his preſent aſſiſtance was much deſired) for
theſe Reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> Becauſe the day before when we had
abſolutely reſolved to go, the <hi>Indians</hi> plainly told us they
thought we were but in jeſt, and alſo that Engliſh-men did talk much but
not fight, nay they concluded that they would not goe on: and beſides if we
ſhould deferre, we feared we ſhould be diſcovered by reaſon of the
frequent recourſe between them by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Squaws</hi> (who have mutual
recourſe) whereupon we were conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſet forward toward the
<hi>Pequods,</hi> with ſeventy ſeven Engliſh, and about ſixty River
Indians, and as I ſuppoſe near about two hundred <hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi>
and marched that night to the eaſtern <hi>Nianticks,</hi> where we kept our
Rendezvouze that night; The Sachem of the place adding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an hundred of his
men unto us.</p>
            <p>We ſet forward and marched about ten miles, where making an Alta
(or halt) there we held a conſultation with the Indians that deſired to
know what we intended; we told them that we reſolved to aſſault
<hi>Saſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous</hi> his Fort, at which they were all ſtricken, and as it
were amazed with fear, as they plainly confeſſed; and ſo after long
debate and preſſing of them, taxing them with cowardize, ſome of them
reſolved to goe along with us, though I ſuppoſe they had no ſuch
intent, as appeared afterward; ſome of them left us to the number as I
ſuppoſe of an hundred or leſſe; and marching on five miles further, we
made another Alta, where they told us we had near a dozen miles to
<hi>Saffacous</hi> his Fort as we gathered by their relation: Being very weary
in travelling with our arms, amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and proviſion; we were conſtrained
to alter our reſolution, and reſolve to attempt that Fort the which they
had formerly deſcribed to be three or four miles nearer; and alſo one of
Capt. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderhills</hi> men failing put it out of doubt. But whoſoever
ſaith that Capt. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderhill</hi> had any falling out about that or any
thing elſe, doth ſpeak untruth: for we both reſolved to
<hi>Saſſacous</hi> his Fort, as we concluded in our conſultation at
<hi>Narrhaganſet,</hi> and ſo continued our reſolution till we received
the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reaſons as grounds ſufficient to perſwade us to the contrary,
and to proſecute that which was moſt likely to be accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>They drew a Plot of the ſcituation of the <hi>Pequods</hi> and
deſcribed <hi>Saſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous</hi> his Fort to be the neareſt, which was the
chief cauſe we determined to aſſault that firſt, and had no reaſon
leading till our laſt Alta, where upon the reaſons formerly mentioned, we
changed our reſolution: this they much deſired and very much rejoyced; for
it was dreadfull to them to hear the name of <hi>Saſſacous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:171788:75"/>From thence we marched two or three miles
where we kept our ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouze, ſuppoſing we had been within one mile of
the Fort: They ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſent an <hi>Indian</hi> to diſcover beforehand,
brought us newes that they were ſecure, having been fiſhing with many
Canooes at Sea, and diverſe of them walking here and there.</p>
            <p>About two hours before day we marched toward the Fort, being
wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and much ſpent; many of us having ſlept nothing at all.</p>
            <p>And ſo we began to march toward the Fort, the Lord being
plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed wonderfully to to aſſiſt and encourage us; after a tedious
march of three or four miles, about break of day we came fair in view of the
Fort ſtanding on the top of an hill not ſteep; the Indians all falling
back, were ſuddenly vaniſhed out of ſight, ſo we made an Alta, and
ſent back for our Guide, who had promiſed to goe with us to the Fort, but
his heart we ſaw much failed him; we asked him what they intended who
promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to wing us, and to ſurround the Fort; he told us they were much
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid; but he ſeing our reſolution went to them and prevailed with
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of them to come up to us; we told them their beſt courſe would
be to flanke the Fort on both ſides, and having no time longer to conferre,
we proceeded; Capt. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderhill</hi> to the weſtern entrance with one
diviſion, my ſelf with the other to the eaſtern as ſilently as
poſſibly we could, ſo it pleaſed God we came up with the Paliſado
within two rod, before we were diſcovered, at which time a dog began to bark,
&amp; an <hi>Indian</hi> cried out, but not being my ſelf rightly informed by
the <hi>Indian</hi> of the right en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, though there was a little poſtern
door, the which I had thought to have attempted to break down with my foot; but
the Lord directed me otherwiſe for the better; for I then feared we could not
there enter with our armes, which proved true, ſo I ſuddenly haſted to
the Paliſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, and putting in the muzzle of my piece, diſcharged upon them,
and ſo the reſt with all celerity; and ſuddenly haſtned on toward that
ſide which ſtood toward the water; where I concluded was an entrance, and
inſtantly fell upon it, being only barred with two great forked boughs, or
branches of ſome tree, and haſting over them, I drew one after me my
Lieutenant the other way outward; then we ſuddenly fell upon the Wigwams, the
Indians cryed out in moſt hideous manner, ſome iſſuing out of the
Wigwams, ſhooting at us deſperately, and ſo creeping un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der beds that
they had. We had reſolved awhile not to have burned it, but being we could
not come at them, I then reſolved to ſet it on fire, after diverſe of
them were ſlain, and ſome of our men ſore wounded: So entring one of
their wigwams, I took a fire-brand [<hi>at which time an Indian drawing an

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:171788:75"/> Bow-ſtring with his Courtlace</hi>] and ſuddenly
kindled a fire in the matts wherewith they were covered, and fell to a retreat
and ſurrounded the Fort; the fire encreaſing violently, inſomuch as that
they were conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to climb to the top of the Paliſadoe; from whence
they were ſoon fetcht down, I ſuppoſe to the number of an hundred and
forty; many of of them iſſuing forth were ſuddenly ſlain either by the
Engliſh or Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who were in a ring without us, all being diſpatched
and ended in the ſpace of an hour, having two of our men ſlain, and
ſixteen wounded.</p>
            <p>Being very hot and dry we could very hardly procure any water,
where we continued one hour not knowing what courſe to take or which way to
go, our Pinnaces not being come in, neither did we know how far, or which way
to go to them; our Interpreter being an Indian and they ſo hurried and
diſtracted with a few hurt men, but chiefly as I conceive with fear of the
Enemy, who ſuddenly approached, that we could hardly come to ſpeak with
him, who knew nothing what they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
            <p>But the Enemy approaching they began to cleave unto us, and I
veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think durſt not leave us.</p>
            <p>Our Pinnaces then coming in view with a fair gale, being guided as
it were to ſerve our neceſſity by the good hand of God, which I think was
never more eminently ſeen in a matter of like moment and leſs of man in
ſeveral paſſages. Then we ſet our men in order and prepared for fight
and began to march toward the Harbour where the Pinnaces were to ride: the
Enemy approaching Capt. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderhill</hi> with divers Indians and certain
Engliſh iſſued out to encounter them, but they would not ſtand to it,
for the moſt part they lay behind Rocks, Trees and Buſhes, we marched on
they ſtill dodging of us; ſometimes deſperately hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves
in open field, where ſome of them were ſlain in open view, and as we hear
many <hi>wounded:</hi> I was ſomewhat cautelous in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing many ſhot
upon them needleſly, becauſe I expected a ſtrong op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and thus
they continued to follow us till we came within two miles of our Pinnaces where
they wholly left us, which vvas near ſix miles as I conceive, having then
about tvvo miles more to the River.</p>
            <p>Four of our wounded men we were forced to carry our ſelves,
while at length we hired the <hi>Indians</hi> to bear them, both in this and
all their following enterpriſes againſt the <hi>Pequods:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here note that one <hi>Wequaſh</hi> a <hi>Pequod</hi> fell from
his Country-men, and proved a Guide to the Engliſh.</p>
            <p>This ſervice being thus happily accompliſhed by theſe few
hands that <pb n="128" facs="tcp:171788:76"/> came from <hi>Connecticut,</hi> within a while
after, the Forces ſent from the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> under the conduct
of Captain <hi>Stoughton</hi> as Commander in chief arrived there alſo, who
found a great part of the work done to their hands, in the ſurprizal of the
<hi>Pequods</hi> Fort as aforeſaid, which yet was but the breaking of the
neſt, and unkenneling thoſe ſalvage Wolves; for the Body of them, with
<hi>Saſſacous</hi> the chief Sachem (whoſe very name war a terrour to all
the <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi>) were diſperſed abroad and ſcattered all
over their Country, yet ſo far diſmayed, that they never durſt make any
aſſault upon the Engliſh, that in ſeveral parties were ſcatered about
in purſuit of them.</p>
            <p>It was not long after Capt. <hi>Stonghtons</hi> Souldiers came up
before news was brought of a great number of the Enemy, that were diſcovered
by the ſide of a River up the Country, being firſt trapanned by the
<hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhaganſets,</hi> under pretence of ſecuring them, but they were
truly hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in by them, though at a diſtance, yet ſo as they could not,
or durſt not ſtir from the place, by which means our Forces of the
<hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> had an eaſie Conqueſt of ſome hundreds of
them who were there coup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up as in a Pound: not daring to fight, not able to
fly away, and ſo were all taken without any oppoſition: the men among them
to the number of thirty were turned preſently into <hi>Charons</hi>
Ferry-boat, under the command of Skipper <hi>Gallop,</hi> who diſpatched them
a little without the Harbour; the Females and Children were diſpoſed of
according to the will of the Conquerers, ſome being given to the
<hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> and other Indians that aſſiſted in the
ſervice.</p>
            <p>The reſt of the Enemy being firſt fired out of their ſtrong
hold, were taken and deſtroyed, a great number of them, being ſeized in the
places where they intended to have hid themſelves, the reſt fled out of
their own Country over <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, up toward the <hi>Dutch
Plantation.</hi> Our Souldiers being reſolved by Gods aſſiſtance to
make a final deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of them, were minded to purſue them which way
ſoever they ſhould think to make their eſcape, to which end in the next
place, our Souldiers went by Water towards <hi>New-Haven,</hi> vvhether they
heard, and vvhich in reaſon vvas moſt likely) they bent their courſe?
ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they vvere informed of a great number of them, that had betaken
themſelves to a neighbouring place not far of, vvhither they might hope it
vvas not like they ſhould be purſued; but upon ſearch they found fifty or
ſixty Wigvvams, but vvithout any Indians in any of them, but heard that they
had paſſed along tovvard the <hi>Dutch Plantation,</hi> vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon our
Souldiers that vvere before, all embarked for <hi>Quillepiack,</hi>
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervvards called <hi>New-Haven,</hi> and being landed there, they had not
far <pb facs="tcp:171788:76"/> to march unto the place where it was moſt probable they

               </gap> find or hear of them;
accordingly in their march they met here &amp; there with ſundry of them,
whom they ſlew or took priſoners, amongſt whom were two Sachems, whom
they preſently beheaded; to a third that was either a Sachem or near a kin to
one, they gave his life upon codition that he ſhould goe and enquire where
<hi>Saſſacous</hi> was, and accordingly bring them word; this
<hi>Indian</hi> overlooking all other national or natural obligations, in
conſideration of his life that was received on that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, proved very
true and faithfull to thoſe that ſent him, his order was to have returned
in three dayes, but not being able within ſo ſhort a time to make a full
diſcovery of the buſineſs, &amp; alſo find an handſome way to
eſcape, he made it eight dayes before he returned, in which ſomething fell
out not a little remarkable; for thoſe he was ſent to diſcover,
ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting at the laſt by his withdrawing himſelf that he came for a
Spye, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued after him, ſo as he was forced to fly for his life, and
getting down to the Sea-ſide he accidentally met with a Canooe a little
before turned adrift, by which means he padled by ſome ſhift or other ſo
farr out of the harbour, that making a ſign he was diſcerned of ſome on
board one of the Veſſels that attended on our Souldiers, by whom being
taken up he made known what he had diſcovered: But after he was gone
<hi>Saſſacous</hi> ſuſpecting (and not without juſt cauſe) what the
matter was, made his eſcape from the reſt with twenty or thirty of his men
to the <hi>Mohawkes,</hi> by whom himſelf and they were all murthered
afterward, being hired thereunto by the <hi>Narrhaganſets,</hi> as was
confidently affirmed &amp; believed.</p>
            <p>Thus this treacherous and cruel Villain with his Companions,
having againſt his Faith and promiſe, as well as contrary to the Lawes of
nature and nations, murthered ſeveral others, both of the Dutch and Engliſh
Nation, is in the ſame manner himſelf againſt the lawes of Hoſpitality
murthered by thoſe to whom he fled for refuge; <hi>Vengeance is mine ſaith
the Lord, I will repay it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is worthy our obſervation, that this <hi>Saſſacous</hi>
the chief Sachem of the <hi>Pequods,</hi> as <hi>Philip</hi> of
<hi>Mount-hope,</hi> (both of them in their ſeveral times and places the
contrivers of many bloudy and cruel miſchiefs, yet) eſcaped the hands of
thoſe whom they had ſo many wayes provoked to the utmoſt degree of
indignation, that ſo they might not too much gratifie their own ſpirits in

ranging up and down as providence guided them, at the laſt, <hi>July</hi> 13.
1637. they lighted upon a great number of them, they purſued in a ſmall
<hi>Indian</hi> town ſeated by the ſide of an hideous Swamp (near the place
where <hi>Fairfield</hi> or <hi>Stratford</hi> now ſtand) into which they all
ſlipt as well <hi>Pequods</hi> as natives of the place; before our men could
make any ſhot upon them, having placed a Centinel to give warning; Mr.
<hi>Ludlow</hi> and Capt. <hi>Maſon</hi> with half a ſcore of their men
hapned to diſcover this crew. Capt. <hi>Patrick</hi> and Capt. <hi>Trask</hi>
with about an hundred of the <hi>Maſſachuſet</hi> Forces came in upon
them preſently after the alarm was given; ſuch Commanders as firſt
hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be there gave ſpecial order that the Swamp ſhould be
ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (being about a mile in Compaſs) but Lieutenant
<hi>Davenport</hi> belonging to Capt. <hi>Trask</hi> his Company, not hearing
the word of Command, with a douzen more of his Company in an over eager
purſuit of the enemy, ruſhed immediately into the Swamp, where they were
very rudely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by thoſe evening wolves that were then kennelled
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for Lieft. <hi>Davenport</hi> was ſorely wounded in the Body,
<hi>John Wedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> of <hi>Ipſwich</hi> in the belly, and was laid hold
on alſo by ſome of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians; Thomas Sherman</hi> of the ſaid
<hi>Ipſwich</hi> in the neck; ſome of their neighbours that ventured in
with them were in danger of the Enemies arrows that flew very thick about them,
others were in as much hazzard of being ſwallowed by the miery boggs of the
Swamp wherein they ſtuck ſo faſt, that if Serjeant <hi>Riggs</hi> of
<hi>Roxbury</hi> had not reſcued two or three of them they had fallen into
the hands of the enemy; but ſuch was the ſtrength and courage of thoſe
that came to the reſcue, that ſome of the Indians being ſlain with their
Swords, their friends were quickly reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and drawn out of the mire and
danger.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Indians</hi> of the place, who had for company ſake
run with their Gueſts the <hi>Pequods</hi> into the ſwamp, did not love
their friendſhip ſo well as to be killed with them alſo for company
ſake, wherefore they began to bethink themſelves that they had done no
wrong to the Engliſh, and deſired a parly which was granted, &amp;
preſently underſtood by the means of <hi>Thomas Stanton</hi> an exact
Interpreter then at hand, upon which the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem of the place with ſeveral
others their wives and children, that liked better to live quietly in their
wigwams then be buried in the Swampe, came forth and had their lives granted
them: after ſome time of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <pb n="131" facs="tcp:171788:79"/> parley with theſe,
the interpreter was ſent in to offer the like terms to the reſt, but they
were Poſſeſſed with ſuch a ſpirit of ſtupidity and ſullenneſs
that they reſolved rather to ſell their lives for what they could get
there; and to that end began to let fly their arrowes thick againſt him as
intending to make his bloud ſome part of the price of their own; but through
the goodneſs of God toward him, his life was not to be ſold on that
account, he being preſently fetched off.</p>
            <p>By this time night drawing on, our Commanders perceiving on which
ſide of the Swampe the enemies were lodged, gave order to cut through the
Swamp with their ſwords, that they might the better hemme them round in one
corner, which was preſently done, and ſo they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt in all night,
the Engliſh in the circumference plying them with ſhot all the time, by
which meanes many of them were killed and buried in the mire, as they found the
next day. The Swamp by the forementioned device being reduced to ſo narrow a
compaſs, that our ſouldiers ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at twelve foot diſtance could
ſurround it, the enemy was kept in all the night; but a little before
day-break (by reaſon of the Fogge that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to ariſe about that time
obſerved to be the darkeſt time of the night) twenty or thirty of the
luſtieſt of the enemy brake through the Beſiegers, and eſcaped away
into the woods, ſome by violence and ſome by ſtealth dropping away,
ſome of whom notwithſtanding were killed in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit; the reſt were
left to the mercy of the Conquerers, of which many were killed in the ſwamp
like ſullen doggs, that would rather in their ſelf-willedneſs and
madneſs ſit ſtill to be ſhot through or cut in pieces, then receive
their lives for the asking at the hand of thoſe into whoſe power they were
now fallen: Some that are yet living and worthy of credit doe affirm, that in
the morning entring into the Swamp, they ſaw ſeveral heaps of them
ſitting cloſe together, upon whom they diſcharged their pieces laden with
ten or twelve piſtol bullets at a time, putting the muzzles of their pieces
under the boughs within a few yards of them; ſo as beſides thoſe that
were found dead (near twenty) it was judged that many more were killed and
ſunk into the mire and never were mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more by friend or foe: of thoſe
who were not ſo deſperate or ſullen to ſell their lives for nothing,
but yielded in time, the male Children were ſent to the <hi>Bermudas,</hi> of
the females ſome were diſtributed to the Engliſh towns, ſome were
diſpoſed of among the other Indians to whom they were deadly enemies as
well as to our ſelves.</p>

protection, which they then obtained, and have never ſince for feited it any

diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe foregoing. Amongſt the reſt of the Priſoners ſpecial
notice was taken of the Wife of a noted Indian called <hi>Mononotto,</hi> who
with her Children ſubmitted her ſelf, or by the chance of the warre fell
into the hands of the Engliſh: it was known to be by her mediation that two
Engliſh maides (that were taken away from <hi>Wether<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

from death, in requital of whoſe pitty and humanity, the life of her ſelf
and her children was not only granted her, but ſhe was in ſpecial
recommended to the care of that honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able gentleman Mr. <hi>John
Winthrop,</hi> for that time being the worthy Governour of the
<hi>Maſſachuſets;</hi> who taking notice of her modeſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and
behaviour, as well as of her only requeſt (not to ſuffer wrong either as to
the honour of her body or fruit of her womb) gave ſpecial charge concerning
her according to his noble and Chriſtian diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>After this ſlaughter at the Swamp the <hi>Pequods</hi> being
upon every turn expoſed to revenge of the <hi>Mohegins</hi> on one ſide,
and <hi>Narrhaganſets</hi> on the other, choſe rather to ſubmit
themſelves to the Engliſh, by whom they were put, ſome under the
<hi>Mohegin,</hi> and ſome under the <hi>Narrhagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets,</hi> which at
laſt proved the occaſion of the preſent quarrel as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, through
the ambition of <hi>Miantonimo,</hi> as was at firſt related.</p>
            <p>This was the iſſue of the <hi>Pequod Warre,</hi> which in the

not far of; which welcome News put <hi>new Life</hi> into the wearied
Souldiers, that had travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hard many dayes, and met with no <hi>Booty</hi>
till now; eſpecially, when it was confirmed by Intelligence the ſame
inſtant, brought in by their Scouts, that they met with <hi>new Tracks</hi>
which brought them in view of ſome <hi>Wigwams</hi> not far from
<hi>Patucket,</hi> by ſome called <hi>Blackſtones Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> in one of
which the ſaid <hi>Sachem</hi> was at that moment divertizing himſelf, with
the <hi>recital</hi> of <hi>Captain Pierces ſlaughter,</hi> ſurprized by
his men a few dayes before, but the <hi>Alarm</hi> of the Engliſh at that
time heard by himſelf, put by that diſcourſe, <hi>apalled</hi> with the
ſuddenneſs thereof, as if he had been informed by <hi>ſecret Item from
Heaven,</hi> that now his own turn was come: ſo as having but <hi>ſeven
men</hi> about him, he ſent up <hi>two of them</hi> to the <hi>top of the
Hill,</hi> to ſee what the matter was, but they affrighted with the near
approach of the Engliſh, at that time with great ſpeed mounting over a
<hi>fair Champagna</hi> on the other ſide of the Hill, ran by, as if they
wanted time to tell what they ſaw; preſently he ſent a third, who did the
like; then ſending two more on the <hi>ſame Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand,</hi> one of theſe
laſt either indued with <hi>more Courage,</hi> or a better Senſe of his
duty, informed him in <hi>great hast</hi> that all the Engliſh Army was upon
him; whereupon, having no time to conſult, and but little to At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt an
<hi>eſcape,</hi> and no means to defend himſelf; he began to <hi>dodge</hi>
with his <hi>purſuers,</hi> running <hi>round the Hill</hi> on the
<hi>contrary ſide;</hi> but as he was running ſo haſtily by,
<hi>Catapazat</hi> with <hi>twenty</hi> of his <hi>Followers;</hi> and a few of
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> lighteſt of foot, gheſſed by the
<hi>ſwiftneſs</hi> of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he fled as if an Enemy, which made
them immediately take the <hi>Chaſe</hi> after him, as for their lives; he
that was the <hi>ſwifter purſuer,</hi> put him ſo hard to it, that he
caſt off firſt his <hi>Blanket,</hi> then his <hi>ſilver lac'd Coat,</hi>
(given him at <hi>Boston</hi> as a pledge of their <hi>friendſhip,</hi> upon
the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newal</hi> of his <hi>League</hi> in <hi>October</hi> before,) and
<hi>Belt of Peag,</hi> which made <hi>Catapazat</hi> conclude it was the
<hi>right bird,</hi> which made them purſue as eagerly as the other
<hi>fled;</hi> ſo as they forced him to take the water, through which as he
over <hi>haſtily plunged,</hi> his foot <hi>ſlipping</hi> upon a ſtone,
it made <pb n="8" facs="tcp:171788:86"/> him fall into the water <hi>ſo deep,</hi> as it
wetted <hi>his Gun,</hi> upon which <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> he confeſſed ſoon
after, that his <hi>heart</hi> and his <hi>bowels</hi> turned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, ſo
as he became like a <hi>rotten ſtick,</hi> void of <hi>ſtrength;</hi>
inſomuch, as one <hi>Monopoide</hi> a <hi>Pequod,</hi> ſwifteſt of foot,
laid hold of him within <hi>thirty Rod</hi> of the <hi>River ſide,</hi>
without his making any <hi>reſiſtance;</hi> Though he was a very <hi>proper
man,</hi> of <hi>goodly ſtature,</hi> and <hi>great Courage</hi> of mind, as
well as <hi>ſtrength of body;</hi> one of the firſt Engliſh that came up
with him, was <hi>Robert Stanton,</hi> a young man that ſcarce had reached
the <hi>twenty ſecond year</hi> of his Age, yet adventuring to ask him a
queſtion, or two, to whom this <hi>manly Sachem</hi> looking with a little
neglect upon his <hi>youthful face,</hi> replyed in <hi>broken Engliſh;</hi>
you <hi>much Child,</hi> no underſtand <hi>matters of War;</hi> let your
<hi>brother,</hi> or your <hi>chief</hi> come, him I will An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and was as
good as his word; Acting herein, as if by a <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean
Metempſychoſts,</hi> ſome <hi>old Roman Ghoſt</hi> had
poſſeſſed the body of this <hi>Western Pagan:</hi> And like
<hi>Attilius Regulus,</hi> he would not accept of his own Life, when it was
tendred him, upon that (in his account) <hi>low Condition</hi> of
<hi>Complyance</hi> with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> refuſing to ſend an
<hi>old Counſellour</hi> of his to make any motion that way, ſaying, he
knew the Indians would not yield; but more probably he was not willing they
ſhould, chooſing rather to <hi>ſacrifice</hi> his own, and his
<hi>peoples lives</hi> to his <hi>private humour</hi> of <hi>Revenge,</hi> than
timely to provide for <hi>his own,</hi> and <hi>their ſafety,</hi> by
entertaining the <hi>Counſels</hi> of a <hi>Peace,</hi> ſo neceſſary
for the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral good</hi> of all; He continuing in the ſame his
<hi>obſtinate Reſolution,</hi> was carryed ſoon after to
<hi>Stonington,</hi> where he was <hi>ſhot to death,</hi> by ſome of his
own <hi>quality, ſc.</hi> the <hi>young Sachem</hi> of the <hi>Mohegins,</hi>
and two of the <hi>Pequods</hi> of like quality. This was the Confuſion of a
<hi>damned wretch,</hi> that had often opned his mouth to <hi>blaſpheme</hi>
the Name of the <hi>living God</hi> and thoſe that make profeſſion
thereof. He was told at large of his <hi>breach of Faith,</hi> and how he
boaſted he would not deliver up a <hi>Wampanoog,</hi> or the paring of a
<hi>Wampanoogs naile,</hi> that He would burn the <hi>Engliſh</hi> alive in
their houſes, to which he replyed, others were as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for the War as
himſelf; and that he deſired to hear no more thereof. And when he was told
his <hi>Sentence</hi> was to dye, he ſaid, he liked it well, that he ſhould
dy before his heart was ſoft, or had ſpoken any thing unworthy of
himſelf. He told the Engliſh before they put him to death, that the killing
him, would not end the War; but it was a conſiderable ſtep thereunto, nor
did it live much longer after his death, at leaſt, not in thoſe parts; For
after <hi>Sudbury fight,</hi> when the Sun of their hopes was at its
<hi>higheſt. April the eighteenth</hi> following, it <hi>viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
declined,</hi> till it ſet in a night of <hi>obſcure</hi> and <hi>utter
darkneſs</hi> upon them all, as is to be feared.</p>

<hi>Heathen:</hi> And indeed, of all the <hi>Enimies</hi> that have been the
Subjects of the <hi>precedent diſcourſe;</hi> This <hi>Villain</hi> did
moſt deſerve to become an <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and

though <hi>leaden feet:</hi> This <hi>cruel Monster</hi> is fallen into their
<hi>power,</hi> that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay him <hi>ſeven fold:</hi> In the firſt
place therefore, making a <hi>great Circle,</hi> they placed him in the
<hi>middle,</hi> that all their Eyes might at the ſame time, be pleaſed
with <hi>utmoſt Revenge</hi> upon him; They firſt cut one of his
<hi>Fingers</hi> round in the <hi>joynt,</hi> at the <hi>Trunck</hi> of his
<hi>hand,</hi> with a <hi>ſharp knife,</hi> and then brake it off, as men
uſe to do with a <hi>ſlaughtered Beaſt,</hi> before they
<hi>uncaſe</hi> him; then they cut off another &amp; another, till they had
<hi>dismembred</hi> one hand of all its <hi>digits,</hi> the <hi>blood</hi>
ſometimes ſpirting out in <hi>ſtreams</hi> a <hi>yard</hi> from his hand,
which <hi>barbarous</hi> and <hi>unheard of Cruelty,</hi> the Engliſh were
not able to bear, it forcing <hi>Tears</hi> from their Eyes; yet did not the
<hi>Sufferer</hi> ever <hi>relent,</hi> or ſhew any ſign of
<hi>Anguiſh:</hi> For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked by ſome of his <hi>Tormentors,</hi> how

after the loſs of a <hi>Battle,</hi> that being asked how he liked <hi>the
match ſc.</hi> with our <hi>Prince of Wales,</hi> (which then was the
occaſion of the <hi>quarrel</hi>) made Anſwer, he liked the <hi>match</hi>
well enough, but no whit liked the manner of the <hi>wooing</hi> written by
ſuch <hi>Lines of blood;</hi> but this <hi>unſenſible</hi> and <hi>hard
hearted Monſter</hi> Anſwered, he liked it very well, and found it as
ſweet, as <hi>Engliſh men</hi> did their <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</hi> In this frame he
continued, till his <hi>Executioners</hi> had dealt with the <hi>Toes of his
feet,</hi> as they had done with the <hi>Fingers of his hands;</hi> All the
while making him <hi>dance</hi> round the <hi>Circle,</hi> and <hi>ſing,</hi>
till he had weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both himſelf and them: At laſt they brake the
<hi>bones of his Legs,</hi> after which he was forced to <hi>ſit down,</hi>
which 'tis ſaid he ſilently did, till they had <hi>knockt out his
brains.</hi> Inſtances of this nature ſhould be <hi>Incentive</hi> unto us,
to <hi>bleſs the Father of Lights,</hi> who hath called us out from the
<hi>dark places</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> full of the <hi>Habitations of
Cruelty.</hi> When the <hi>Day-ſpring</hi> from on high ſhall viſit
thoſe that ſit in this <hi>Region of darkneſs,</hi> another Spirit will
be poured upon them, and when the feet of them that bring the <hi>glad
Tydings</hi> of <hi>Goſpel Salvation</hi> will appear more <hi>beautiful</hi>
